Abstract: In this paper we discuss how new standards for multimedia module abstraction and storage---developed by the authors under the auspices of the Integra project---can be used as a platform for collaborative art practices. We bring forth questions relating to cross-platform environment-independent storage of all aspects of artistic works including visual representations of data, visual representations of interactive possibilities, and ways in which time based data can be stored and represented. We present an object-oriented model for information relating to artworks and performances involving live electronic processing. In this model objects, as well as their inherent relations and connections, are abstracted from implementation-specific details. The resulting graphs of interrelations may consist of objects describing performances, artists, organizations, DSP modules, time-based data and other data relating to the artistic work.
