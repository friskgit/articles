* Introduction

** Anxiety about the validity of improvisation
Improvisation is still the rebel (?)

. . .

It should be the norm, not the fringe alternative...
#+pause:
structurally enforced

** Critique
The discussion has a tendency to excluded many non-western types of improvised music

- Kamoche & Pina E. Cunha (2008)
- Frisk & Östersjö (2013) 

Improvisation as a stylistic delimiter is problematic


* Four themes
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- method
- ethics
- play
- knowledge
** Method
The practice of improvisation as a method with which different values may be proposed

** Ethics
The practice of improvisation reveals a certain possibility for ethics

Focus is on /what happens/, not /how to make it happen/

** Play
Play, or free-play, is the activity that is not bound to a particular concept

** Knowledge
Whether musical practices can give rise to knowledge outside of its own field

- it is not the art object as knowledge (though it could be), it is the /doing/ of art


* Method
Control or giving up the control?

#+puase:
#+begin_quote
When improvising, am I creating material when I play or do I find it?
#+end_quote
#+puase:
Creating/Finding: problematic metaphors, but useful methodological tools

* Foucault: /Practices of freedom/

In this method a particular development between self and others is at the core

Inspired by Foucault's notion of the /care of the self/, a self that is rooted in "practices of freedom" 

** ethics, freedom and reflection

#+begin_quote
Freedom is the ontological condition of ethics. But ethics is the considered form that freedom takes when it is informed by reflection.
#+end_quote

Foucault, Rabinow & Hurley (1997) Ethics: Subjectivity and Truth, New Press, New York.

** summary
As long as I care about the relation between myself and the other, and the larger context, I can be free to follow my artistic and ethically informed intentions, which will enforce my freedom
 
* The care of the self as practice

The care of the self is not a solipsitic activity

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 400
[[file:img/self_care.jpg]]

** Foucault

#+begin_quote
When you take care of the body you do not take care of the self. The self is not clothing, tools, or possessions; It is to be found in the principle that uses these tools, a principle not of the body of the soul.
#+end_quote

** Foucault

#+begin_quote
 You have to worry about your soul--that is the principal activity for caring for yourself. The care of the self is the care of the activity and not the care of the soul-as-substance. 
#+end_quote

** Foucault

#+begin_quote
 You have to worry about your improvisation--that is the principal activity for caring for yourself. The care of the self is the care of the activity and not the care of the improvisation-as-substance. 
#+end_quote

The principle that uses the tools of artistic practice is in essence the aesthetics of the creative act: the practice itself.

* The care of the self: a focus on the world around me
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- connections exist, matter, and need to be good and respectful
- a developed sense of ethics comes from a deep understanding for the relations I'm engaged in
- maybe paves the way for a artistic knowledge claim
  - through these /connections/ knowledge may be developed
    
* Ethics: motivation
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500
[[file:img/capitalism.png]]

** moral questions
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ./img/capitalism2.png
:reveal_background_trans: slide
:END:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- the power relations between the arts and the control structures of capitalism are, in an understatement, unequal
- the possiblity for interpretations of moral questions is shrinking.
- the panoptic control structures of social-media become second nature and they offer an understanding of ethics that is both normative and irrational.
  
** music
Both music and ethics lack clear definitions - yet, they are incredibly important

Ethics in artistic practice, that is, the moral values that are expressed through artistic practices in music, may complement traditional views on ethics.

** examples

* Play
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- ethics of artistic practice is described here as a form for play
- the artistic practice enables new ethical perspectives.
- the /play/ is for the sake of playing
- the bi-product is knowledge and the discovery of the meaning of concepts outside of the play.

* Play
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- play is the antidote of capitalist consumption, which is always transactional.
- the former creates freedom and the latter consumes it.
  
** definition
this free play of associations is perhaps best described by Susanne Langer (2009) as a /uncritical fusion of impressions, that exercise the powers of symbolic transformation/

** framework
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- judgments such as right and wrong are useless to employ in music
- they are equally difficult to determine in ethics
- in both cases there is a need for a framework through which the judgements may be applied
- Artistic practice, developed through the care of the self, is proposed as such a framework

** The interactions are the primary interest

It is the interactions that are made possible by engaging in an artistically driven play with the objects:
 - a free play with no particular meaning

In this free play I can engage with certain questions in a way that would otherwise not have been possible. Improvisation is part of the method that allows me to do this.

* Knowledge
** Knowledge in artistic research
many attempts to draw wide-ranging conclusions on the knowledge gained
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Nooshin (2003) Improvisation as ‘Other’: Creativity, knowledge and power–the case of Iranian classical music, Journal of the Royal Musical Association.
- Holdhus, Høisæter & Mæland et al. (2016) Improvisation in teaching and education—roots and applications, Cogent Education.
** Knowledge in artistic research
- Vera, Nemanich & Vélez-Castrillón et al. (2016) Knowledge-based and contextual factors associated with R&D teams’ improvisation capability, Journal of Management.
- Kamoche & Pina E. Cunha (2008) Improvisation and knowledge: the challenge of appropriation, Management Research: Journal of the Iberoamerican Academy of Management.

** Improvisation develops networks
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- the various parts of the system are interrogated in a playful manner
- the moral values that are expressed through artistic practices in music, specifically improvisation, may complement traditional views on ethics
- rooted in a relational ontology
  
** central question
how thinking about improvisation in this way may allow me to understand the ways I may approach the other in and through this practice

I will attempt to devise a method with which I can understand and explore these processes from the inside of my own practice, well aware of the potential limitations in scope that this will carry.

** improvisation as method
improvisation is a method with which musical and human relations can be explored
and with which new music can be found and created.

** knowledge claim
The knowledge lies in the connections between the various agents involved in the practice

* Summary
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- improvisation, is a good method for investigating this ethics of practice
- it can provide us access to important knowledge about relations through relations
- this knowledge transcends biographical information

* Summary
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- the knowledge claim, I argue, is in the way the various parts of the system is organized
- it is through the practice that the knowledge is revealed
- it is through new connections that it is conveyed
- it is the way that the network grows that shows its epistemological potential

* Thank you!
