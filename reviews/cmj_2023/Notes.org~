The ability to improvise
on stage with others is considered to be one of the great achievements or examples of
human creativity. It requires empathy, quick-wittedness, an awareness of the genre, an
awareness of the audience and each other, and a huge source of patterns that can be used
appropriately given the correct contextual settings.

Insights gained from understanding musicians’ physical mechanisms when
improvising together provide a valuable resource to design communication mechanisms
that facilitate improvisational interaction between human and AI musicians.
#+END_QUOTE
This section speculates on how "Insights gained from understanding musicians’ physical mechanisms when
improvising together" can be useful and how the interface of an AI system may be improved, but this is not something that you have studied. I would suggest this is removed or moved to another section of the paper.

The usefulness of the thematic analysis, which is generally interesting and well performed would be furthered improved if the reader was allowed insight into what kind of musical gestures/interaction were coupled with the various tags. What is, for example, structured about this tag in a musical sense.

explores the concept of bi-directional communication by giving the system autonomy to
send signals to the human musician.
#+END_QUOTE

Since this is a thematic analysis, a code given cannot said to be given the system autonomy. the code, unless I've misunderstood something, signals that a certain aspect of autonomy in the system was observed by the improvisor.

What follows here, the example of the Shimon marimba robot and the use of emoticons appear to rather be systems that improve multimodal communication in performance and perhaps not so much the inner workings of the system?

Here we propose that all music improvisations systems
should employ some type of ’presence’ that embodies the system in order to communicate
aspects of the inner workings of the system, but also we propose that the interplay of
moments of silence with some kind of embodiment, or for that matter, any kind of
‘presence’ that is implemented for an improvisational system (e.g. a digital visualisation),
would play a significant role in conveying emotional meaning.

** Review
*** Is the subject matter and presentation appropriate for this special issue? Please explain if not.
   This paper discusses the ways in which humans and AI music systems can signal to each other but the focus is not on the AI, the ways it functions, nor on the system itself. Instead the authors have performed a thematic analysis based on a set of improvisers experiences with playing with the system. The thematic analysis is well done and the method is, in general, used wisely. However, there are a few facts that are problematic:
   1. The first is the fact that although many of the references point to jazz improvisation, it is never stated what kind of musical practice the study is performed on. This reduces the usefulness of the results to a significant degree as the term 'improvisation', widely used throughout, is ambiguous at best. The interactive requirements that a performer would have on an AI improviser varies to a great degree with what kind of improvisation the musician is comfortable with.
   2. Similarly is it not clear whether or not the participants are all jazz musicians or what their musical expertise is, only that they are experienced musicians. If the reader can't tell if the participant is a fiddle player, a concert violinist or a free jazz improviser, many of the results are less useful.
   3. The description of AI system, in essence a VMM, is solely focused on how the system chooses the next output based on the input but not in any way in relation to a musical logic. This is related to the first point above: not knowing what kind of musical system is being modelled, or why it has been designed in the first place (possibly only for the purposes of doing this study?), here makes it difficult to understand the analysis later in the paper. 

*** Does the manuscript meet its stated goals; are they meaningful for the material? Please explain if not.

The manuscript does meet its stated goals but would benefit from editing. Apart from what is already mentioned the structure of the paper is a bit unorthodox which makes this reader lose focus. The concept of silence, which appears very important to the authors (I am less convinced) is introduced after the description of the results of the study. It would be better to collect the theory in one place, before the presentation of the study, and state the suggested importance of silence already from the start.

*** Are the ideas presented clearly; is the presentation well organized? Please explain if not.

See above. There are a range of minor language errors and idiomatically incorrect phrasings. I believe, especially for this context, that the system should be better described. That it is using markov chains says very little about the way it works: does it use harmony? How is rhythm generated? Melody? Etc.
*** Have the authors ignored significant work or contradictory results? Please explain if not.

The results from the thematic analysis are well described but the way the authors connect them back to the aim is a bit vague.
*** Is the manuscript significantly different from previously published work? Please explain if not.

I believe this manuscript is different from previously published work.
*** Does the manuscript require any additional audio and/or video material in order to be evaluated by you or understood by readers? Please explain if so.
 
The thematic analysis would be greatly enhanced with music examples and/or notation that exemplifies what kind of musical phrase generated the code. Without this the paper, in my opinion, falls short.
*** Recommendation: For this special issue of Computer Music Journal, the manuscript should be (select one):
_X_ published after reviewing major revisions 

*** Please justify your recommendation, and provide general feedback about the manuscript.

Should the paper be complemented with the things I feel are missing, it could be published, but in its present form it should be rejected. What should probably be weighed in here is whether or not the strengths of this paper--the thematic analysis of musician's experiences with an automated system--is within the scope of the theme of this issue. Had the description of the system been better described this question would have less importance, but as it is, the paper has an emphasis towards musicology rather than computer music studies.

In summary, I am hesitant to whether this paper fits the theme, but this is something you obviously are better to judge.
