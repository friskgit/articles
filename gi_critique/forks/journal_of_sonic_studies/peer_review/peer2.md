**[REVIEW FORM]{.smallcaps}**

-   PART 1: General information

**As a reviewer, you represent your community, and your review should be
professional and constructive. The quality of the *Journal of Sonic
Studies* (*JSS*) depends on the quality of reviews, which we consider to
be more about "engaging" with the submission than "judging" it. The job
of the reviewer is to select high-quality, innovative submissions for
*JSS*, and to suggest ways to improve the research as well as to uphold
and/or raise the standards of the sound studies community as a whole. A
persuasive review includes a summary of the strengths and weaknesses of
the submission, and the opinion of the reviewer regarding these.**

-   PART 2: Overall quality of the textual part of the submission

**Although we explicitly invite both (academic) scholars and artists to
contribute, we expect all contributions to have a firm theoretical
grounding. The primary aim of *JSS* is to further develop the discourse
on sound studies. Please give your opinion on the textual part of the
submission, in 500 words or less, highlighting its strengths and
weaknesses, and, if possible or deemed necessary, suggest ways to
improve the submission, while taking into account the following
criteria:**

-   Is the text based on clear objectives?

> The text reads more like a speculative philosophical essay stating the
> author\'s opinion about intuition when working with and listening to
> sounds.

- attempted to address

-   Does it contain an adequate account of the methodological approach?

> No. I don't think this would apply in this case. The text does not
> present the results of a research project as such. Thus, there is no
> methodology.

- addressed

-   Does it offer a consistent and logical argument?

> Yes. The text is well-written and provides references to support the
> arguments. But I must confess that I am not familiar with some of the
> philosophical literature cited.

-   What can you say about the structure of the submission: would
    specific alternatives make it a better contribution?

> It is okay. It makes an interesting reading.

-   Does it offer a relevant contribution to the field of sonic studies,
    by contributing to a better understanding, empirical or otherwise,
    of sonic phenomena, a theoretical development in the field of sonic
    studies, or a problematization of existing views?

> I am not entirely convinced this makes a relevant contribution to the
> field, in the sense that I don't feel the ideas are novel and indeed
> practical.
>
> It would help if the author(s) could give concrete examples from their
> portfolio of work. I assume there is a body of practical work. For
> instance, on page 8, two paragraphs start with "As a composer ..." and
> then "As an improviser ...". However there is no mention or reference
> to how their practice relates to the ideas being discussed here.

- marked and addressed

-   Is the topic contextualized, which may include social, artistic,
    and/or theoretical issues that the author responds to?

> See above.

-   Does it make adequate reference to the existing literature or is
    there important literature which is omitted?

> My familiarity with the literature is superficial. But in any case, I
> think that Bergson's concept of memory is outdated. Neuroscience has
> made a lot of progress, which has surely helped to advance
> philosophical concepts about memory, mind and perception. For example,
> P. Churchland's "Plato's Camera". But as far as I can tell, the
> references are adequate.

- addressed: question about Churchland

-   PART 3: Overall quality of the non-textual materials

**The *JSS* editors welcome scholarly as well as artistic research. In
both cases, especially welcomed are those contributions which explicitly
use the Research Catalogue as a medium, e.g. by inserting A/V materials,
hyperlinks, and the use of non-conventional, non-linear structures.
Please give your opinion on the non-textual materials of the submission,
and, if possible or deemed necessary, suggest ways to improve the
submission, in 200 words or less, taking into account the following
criteria:**

-   Does the quality of the A/V material fits *JSS*? There is no A/V
    material.

-   Does the submission demonstrate a good balance between textual and
    A/V materials? N/A

-   Does the author make good use of hyperlinks or other materials
    already available on the Internet? There are no hyperlinks. Only
    link to papers in the references.

-   PART 4: Your general opinion on the text

**Please give your overall recommendation concerning this submission by
selecting option A, B, C, or D:**

A.  The submission is suitable for publication by the *Journal of Sonic
    Studies*, once routine editing has been completed

I think it makes an entertaining reading, but I don't feel it makes a
substantial contribution to sonic studies. I would strongly suggest
giving actual sonic examples with respective notes to illustrate the
various points the author(s) wish(es) to make. Illustrations would make
it clearer, and possibly more relevant for the journal, what the paper
intends to convey.

B.  The submission is suitable for publication by the *Journal of Sonic
    Studies*, if substantial changes are made

C.  The submission is not suitable for publication by the *Journal of
    Sonic Studies*, unless a thoroughly revised version is submitted for
    re-evaluation

D.  The submission is not suitable for publication by the *Journal of
    Sonic Studies*
