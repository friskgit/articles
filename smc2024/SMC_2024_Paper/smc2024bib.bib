   abstract = {Listeners experience electroacoustic music as full of significance and meaning, and they experience spatiality as one of the factors contributing to its meaningfulness. If we want to understand spatiality in electroacoustic music, we must understand how the listeners mental processes give rise to the experience of meaning. In electroacoustic music as in everyday life, these mental processes unite the peripheral auditory system with human spatial cognition. In the discussion that follows we consider a range of the listeners mental processes relating space and meaning from the perceptual attributes of spatial imagery to the spatial reference frames for places and navigation. When considering multichannel loudspeaker systems in particular, an important part of the discussion is focused on the distinctive and idiomatic ways in which this particular mode of sound production contributes to and situates meaning. These include the phenomenon of image dispersion, the important consequences of the precedence effect and the influence of source characteristics on spatial imagery. These are discussed in close relation to the practicalities of artistic practice and to the potential for artistic meaning experienced by the listener. © 2010 Cambridge University Press.},

   abstract = {This article presents a multimodal exploratory study aimed at searching for evidence that can guide us in the adoption and/or improvement of appropriate theoretical-methodological approaches for studying the role of the spatiality/spatialisation of sound and the cognitive/affective empathic processes involved in the acousmatic experience. For this purpose, controlled listening sessions were conducted in which fragments of different loudspeaker music were presented. The subjects reported their emotional experience and the degree of familiarity they assigned to each sound fragment. Specific questions for the acousmatic fragments inquire into the potential relationships between the sound stimulus and the emotion declared by the subjects. From these experiences, qualitative reports were obtained through a semi-structured interview, and electrodermal activity (EDA) logs were recorded in parallel for an intended group. Based on these results, it is argued that spatiality might be linked to a complex cognitive-affective response from the listeners and emerges as a distinctive element of the meaning that the listeners ascribe to their acousmatic musical experience.},

   abstract = {Sound spatialization is a technique used in various musical genres as well as in soundtrack production for films and video games. In this context, specialized software has been developed for the design of sound trajectories we have classified as (1) basic movements, or image schemas of spatial movement; and (2) archetypal geometric figures. Our contribution is to reach an understanding of how we perceive the movement of sound in space as a result of the interaction between an agent’s or listener’s sensory-motor characteristics and the morphological characteristics of the stimuli and the acoustic space where such interaction occurs. An experiment was designed involving listening to auditory stimuli and associating them with the aforementioned spatial movement categories. The results suggest that in most cases, the ability to recognize moving sound is hindered when there are no visual stimuli present. Moreover, they indicate that archetypal geometric figures are rarely perceived as such and that the perception of sound movements in space can be organized into three spatial dimensions—height, depth, and width—which the literature on sound localization also confirms.},

@phdthesis{Solomon2007,
   abstract = {With so much attention given to pitch space in contemporary analytic discourse, theorists have largely ignored the important relationships unfolding within the physical space of musical performance. I propose an analytic methodology for identifying, classifying, and interpreting "spatial gestures." A spatial gesture emerges from the consecutive activity of multiple performers within an ensemble. Various gestures are differentiated by the specific orderings, in time, of sonic events occurring at separate points in ensemble space. Employing integer notation derived from contour theory, gestures may be assigned SG-labels. These labels assist in identifying structural relations between different gestures and in assigning a gesture to one of several "gestural categories." The classification of spatial gestures is based on theories of form perception taken from Gestalt psychology. As a unified whole comprising ordered parts (gestalt structure), a spatial gesture is directed motion through an ensemble that often serves a motivic function: a gesture may be developed and transformed, and the profusion of related gestures imparts spatial coherence to a work of music. Furthermore, the specific directionality and kinetic shape of a spatial gesture is rich in interpretive potential. Image-schema theory and the theory of conceptual metaphor are evoked to construct a hermeneutic account of spatio-gestural activity.},

   abstract = {One of Pierre Schaeffer's achievements in his musical research was his proposal of the sound object as a basic unit of musical experience and his insistence on listening as a main focus of research. Out of this research grew a radical new music theory of sound-based composition. This article will draw on this extensive research to explore the spaces where this music is heard and present the claim that the space in which music is experienced is as much a part of the music as the timbral material itself. The key question here is the changes made to timbral material through acousmatic spatial listening and the subjective analysis affordance of the listeners' placement and perspective. These consequences are studied from a phenomenological and psychoacoustic perspective and it is suggested that Schaeffer's research on timbral and musical concepts can be extended to include spatial features.},

   abstract = {There are many studies which identify the compositional exploration and exploitation of space throughout history [1, 2]; in the twentieth century-and particularly in acous-matic music-the spatial experience has become one of the central musical concerns [3]. The qualities of sound moving in space might be considered distinct in instrumental or voice-based music if compared to electroacous-tic and acousmatic music, where spatialisation technologies and reproduction systems have given a great range of possibilities to composers. By introducing a coupling-decoupling process for the analysis of spatial motions and their sounding parameters, it is possible to abstract movements in space from their intrinsic timbral characteristics that might be applicable in the studies of a range of music, both instrumental and electroacoustic. The concept of spatial sonorous object is introduced and used as basic unit for the analysis of the Notturno in D major K.286 by W.A. Mozart and identification of spatial motion archetypes. In this discussion, a preliminary analysis of 'traditional' spatial sound movements is proposed together with a process of coupling-decoupling, an approach in linking spatial movements from different music contexts and their repurpose in the creative practice.},

   abstract = {Electroacoustic music lacks a definitive vocabulary for describing its spatiality. Not only does it lack a vocabulary for describing the spatial attributes of individual sound sources, it lacks a vocabulary for describing how these attributes participate in artistic expression. Following work by Rumsey, the definition of spatial attributes is examined in the broader context of auditory scene analysis. A limited number of spatial attributes are found to be adequate to characterize the individual levels of organization nested within the auditory scene. These levels are then viewed in relationship to auditory spatial schemata, the recurrent patterns by which listeners understand the behavior of sound in space. In electroacoustic music the interrelationship of spatial attributes and spatial schemata is often engaged in a play of perceptual grouping that blurs and confounds distinctions like source and ensemble. Our ability to describe and categorize these complex interactions depends on having clear concepts and terminology. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},
