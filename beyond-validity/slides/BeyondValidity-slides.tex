\frametitle{Why Beyond?}


\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> \emph{Validity}: we measure what we intend to measure
\item<1-> Outside the hard sciences, this is very difficult to prove
\item<2-> In artistic research there is a need to go \alert{beyond} the traditional \emph{Validity} concept
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Why Legacy?}
  
  \begin{quotation}
  \noindent
    In the present paper we suggest that the development of artistic research
    is at a point where it is no longer productive to discuss it as a field in
    development in which methods and formats are in a constant flux but one
    where we need to discuss a set of of defining frames and methods for
    researchers to use or depart from.
  \end{quotation}

  \frametitle{The Academy: friend or foe?}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> The Academy is emables research
  \item<2-> It may enable art production
  \item<3-> So long as research is focused on practice and rigorous credibility is not an issue
  \item<4-> Academic evalutation may work with an established network
  \item<5-> With efficient documentation we will not need particular writing styles
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The dynamics of artistic work and the academy}
  
The discussion concerning art and research and whether they can coexist and survive the relationship may be seen to rest on misconceptions of both topics. 

\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Zone of uncertainty
\item<2-> ``be wary about attempts to regulate artistic research''
\item<3-> Many other research diciplines are as abstract and subjective
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Artistic Reflection and Metods}
  
  \section{Reflection}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> All artistic practice involves reflection
  \item<2-> Reflection is a tool, not a method

  \end{itemize}
