@article{1972,
	Abstract = {The author notes that the concept of the
                  interdependence of space and time is one of the most
                  exciting ones in contemporary physics and
                  philosophy. In works of art, there is also an
                  interlocking of space and time, however, she points
                  out that it does not involve problems of
                  relativistic physics. She outlines the temporal and
                  spatial aspects of music and of different kinds of
                  visual art, such as static painting and sculpture,
                  Op art and kinetic art. The differences between
                  objective space and time, and psychological space
                  and time are discussed as they pertain to these
                  arts. She concludes that it is not correct to
                  classify music as simply a 'temporal' art and the
                  visual arts as 'spatial' arts, for in both of these
                  art forms there is an interrelationship between time
                  and space. /// L'auteur remarque que le concept
                  d'interd{\'e}pendence entre l'espace et le temps est
                  l'un des points les plus passionnants de la physique
                  et de la philosophie contemporaines. Dans les
                  {\oe}uvres d'art, il y a aussi interd{\'e}pendance entre
                  l'espace et le temps; elle note cependant que ces
                  probl{\`e}mes sont distincts de ceux de la physique
                  relativiste. Elle mentionne les aspects temporels et
                  spatiaux de la musique et des diff{\'e}rentes sortes
                  d'art visuel comme la peinture statique et la
                  sculpture, l'Op art et l'art cin{\'e}tique. La
                  diff{\'e}rence entre l'espace et le temps objectifs et
                  l'espace et le temps psychologiques est discut{\'e}e
                  dans le cadre de ces diff{\'e}rentes formes d'art. Elle
                  conclue qu'il n'est pas juste de classer la musique
                  comme un art purement temporel et les arts visuels
                  comme des arts de l'espace car dans les uns comme
                  dans les autres il y a interconnection entre le
                  temps et l'espace.},

	Abstract = {The authors have experimented with the Web to
                  develop its potential for creative, collaborative
                  expression and to explore and sculpt the boundaries
                  between physical space and cyberspace. Their work
                  grew directly out of Nina Sobell's interactive video
                  installations of the early 1970s, in which she used
                  the medium to sculpt space and time and to create
                  bridges for shared human experience. Their
                  inspiration in "ParkBench" has been to address the
                  physical disconnectedness of the information age by
                  creating a safe place to congregate in
                  cyberspace. Their work has inspired the development
                  of new technologies, including a wireless

                  conducting research in the field. Pointing to a

	Abstract = {This article develops a theoretical analysis of
                  music and mediation, building on the work of Theodor
                  Adorno, Tia DeNora and Antoine Hennion. It begins by
                  suggesting that Lydia Goehr"s account of the work
                  concept requires such a perspective. Drawing on
                  Alfred Gell"s anthropology of art, the article
                  outlines an approach to mediation that incorporates
                  understandings of music"s social, technological and
                  temporal dimensions. It suggests that music"s
                  mediations have taken a number of historical forms,
                  which cohere into assemblages, and that we should be
                  alert to shifts in the dominant forms of musical
                  assemblage. In the latter part of the article, these
                  tools are used to conceptualize changing forms of
                  musical creativity that emerged over the twentieth
                  century. A comparison is made between the work
                  concept and jazz and improvised electronic
                  musics. Three contemporary digital music experiments
                  are discussed in detail, demonstrating the concepts
                  of the provisional work and of social, distributed
                  and relayed creativity. Throughout, key motifs are
                  mediation, creativity, and the negotiation of

	ABSTRACT = {This paper provides a systematic review of
                  cross-adaptive audio effects and their
                  applications. These effects extend the boundaries of
                  traditional audio effects by potentially having many
                  inputs and outputs, and deriving their behavior
                  based on analysis of the signals. This mode of
                  control allows the effects to adapt to different
                  material, seemingly “being aware” of what they do to
                  signals. By extension, cross-adaptive processes are
                  designed to take into account features of, and
                  relations between, several simultaneous
                  signals. Thus a more global awareness and
                  responsivity can be achieved in the processing
                  system. When such a system is used in real-time for
                  music performance, we observe cross-adaptive
                  performative effects. When a musician uses the
                  signals of other performers directly to inform the
                  timbral character of her own instrument, it enables
                  a radical expansion of the human-to-human
                  interaction during music making. In order to give
                  the signal interactions a sturdy frame of reference,
                  we engage in a brief history of applications as well
                  as a classification of effects types and
                  clarifications in relation to earlier
                  literature. With this background, the current paper
                  defines the field, lays a formal framework, explores
                  technical aspects and applications, and considers
                  the future of this growing field.}

	abstract = { A central strategy in selling information
                  technology has involved the appropriation of earlier
                  historical notions of the ether: as an immersive
                  environment, communicative medium and electronic
                  presence. Just as telephony was connected to the
                  ‘wireless ether’, virtual reality and cyberspace
                  have been connected to the idea of a virtual,
                  electronic sphere, represented as an informatic
                  space, through which a mode of (digital) being is
                  conducted. However, as this paper will argue, while
                  the data trails generated through ‘dataveillance’
                  technologies, or the information collected by
                  wearable computers, may indeed situate the
                  individual within a digitally rendered ‘ether’,
                  these technologies are based on the generation of
                  knowledge more than the creation of a space,
                  installing an epistemological, rather than an
                  ontological framework for understanding telepresent
                  agency. With reference to recent works by Canadian
                  artist Catherine Richards, this paper will discuss

	Abstract = {Researchers in the arts, media and design often
                  struggle to find serviceable methodologies within
                  the orthodox research paradigms of quantitative and
                  qualitative research. In response to this and over
                  the past decade, practice-led research has emerged
                  as a potent strategy for those researchers who wish
                  to initiate and then pursue their research through
                  practice. This paper examines the dynamics and
                  significance of practice-led research, and argues
                  for it to be understood as a research strategy
                  within an entirely new research paradigm:
                  performative research. Taking its name from
                  J.L. Austin's speech act theory, performative
                  research stands as an alternative to the qualitative
                  and quantitative paradigms by insisting on different
                  approaches to designing, conducting and reporting
                  research. The paper concludes by observing that,
                  once understood and fully theorised, the
                  performative research paradigm will have
                  applications beyond the arts and across the creative
                  and cultural industries gene},

                  industry. It extends the existing analysis of the
                  so-called “MP3 Crisis” by exploring the ways in
                  which digital technologies have challenged the
                  entrenched power of the major record labels. In
                  particular, new insights are offered based on
                  interviews with music industry executives who have
                  been active in shaping the industry's response to
                  illegal file sharing. The paper also uses interview

                  of restructuring at the macroscale on creative
                  talent at the microscale. As such, it documents the

                  tempo based on a real-time estimation of body rhythm
                  and tempo manipulation of audio. A prototype was
                  developed and tested in collaboration with users,
                  followed by a main study where the final prototype
                  was evaluated. A questionnaire was provided to
                  obtain ratings regarding subjective experience, and
                  open-ended questions were posed in order to obtain
                  further insights for future development. Our results

                  historical avant-garde art. His method of interpretation is
                  an intertextual strategy that approaches the historical
                  artifacts through recent phenomena. The first case study is
                  of structural film; its most important attributes appear to
                  be artistic strategies questioning the structural/material
                  integrity, durability and permanence of the film work. The
                  second case study is of the avant-garde strategy of
                  collective work, reinterpreted through the open-source work
                  and interactive art of today. The author identifies three
                  steps in the development of the 20th-century concept of
                  joint creative work: avant-garde general strategies of
                  artistic collaboration; avant-garde film works oriented
                  toward creative collectivism; and collaborative artistic
                  practices that manifest themselves in non-hierarchical

                  Swedish electronic music studio EMS. EMS was
                  established in 1964 with the intent to create an
                  international center for research in sound and sound
                  perception, and to build one of the world’s most
                  advanced hybrid studios. The principal creators of
                  the studio were rooted in Swedish modernism, and had
                  the EMS-project shaped in accordance to the social
                  democratic cultural policy of the time. This enabled
                  the project to achieve continuous financial support,
                  e. g. to purchase a computer in 1969. The
                  construction of the large studio was a complicated
                  and prolonged process. While the building was
                  underway, many composers worked in EMS’s principle
                  provisional studio, where they among other pieces
                  created the so-called text sound compositions. Over
                  time this studio was worn, and the composers asked
                  for new analog equipment. The board of directors
                  opposed the composers’ whishes because they
                  preferred to continue the original stake at
                  digitally controlled analog apparatus and the
                  planned research project. On these grounds many
                  disagreements and conflicts occurred.},

@article{Pinch1998,
	abstract = {In this paper we examine the sociological history of
                  the Moog and Buchla music synthesizers. These
                  electronic instruments were developed in the
                  mid-1960s. We demonstrate how relevant social groups
                  exerted influence on the configuration of
                  synthesizer construction. In the beginning, the
                  synthesizer was a piece of technology that could be
                  designed in a variety of ways. Despite this
                  interpretative flexibility in its design, it
                  stabilised as a keyboard instrument. We examine the
                  contrasting development of the East coast (Moog) and
                  West coast (Buchla) systems, and suggest why one has
                  become a commercially viable mainstream instrument,
                  while the influence of the other has remained
                  marginal. We discuss the tension around viewing the
                  synthesizer as a machine, and investigate its
                  transformation into an instrument. Finally, we look
                  at the vast possibilities of sound originally rooted
                  in the synthesizer, and explain its eventual
                  evolution as an instrument with fixed potential. The
                  double character of the synthesizer — it was an
                  outgrowth of the psychedelic counter-culture which
                  it, in turn, dramatically influenced — illustrates
                  the reciprocal, co-evolutionary role of
                  technological artifacts embedded in a milieu which
                  at the same time they help create.},

@article{Webb2009,
	Abstract = {In this article, I explore the relationship between the philosophy of Theodor Adorno and the Bilderverbot, or biblical Second Commandment against images. My starting point is J. F. Lyotard's construction of the melancholic sublime in his essay 'What is the Postmodern?', which I argue he uses to critique Adorno's aesthetics, and, more generally, his position as a 'modern' thinker. To prove that Lyotard had Adorno in mind when he constructed the category of the melancholic sublime, I return to an earlier piece by Lyotard – 'Adorno as the Devil' – which is a reading of Thomas Mann's Dr Faustus, in which Adorno is said to be one of the faces of the Devil. My argument is that Lyotard's understanding of Adorno is flawed because he does not recognize the distinctly Jewish, albeit secularized, character of his thought. I set out to challenge Lyotard by demonstrating the central importance that the Bilderverbot plays in Adorno's work, which should not be understood as melancholic because the J},

@book{Wiener1961,
	abstract = {Discusses the construction of Netwonian time on the
                  basis of the rotation of the stars and the
                  universe. If we were to take a motion picture of the
                  planets, speeded up to show a perceptible picture of
                  activity, and were to run the film backward, it
                  would still be a possible picture of planets
                  conforming to the Newtonian mechanics. On the other
                  hand, if we were to take a motion-picture photograph
                  of the turbulence of the clouds in a thunderhead and
                  reverse it, it would look altogether wrong. What is
                  the difference between the astronomical and the
                  meteorological situation which brings about all
                  these differences, and in particular the difference
                  between the apparent reversibility of astronomical
                  time and the apparent irreversibility of
                  meteorological time? In this chapter, the author
                  considers the realization that the Newtonian physics
                  was not the proper frame for biology--as time can be
                  reversed in physics, in which nothing new happens,

                  development, including debugging. We present
                  performance measurements for some current operating
                  systems, including NT4, Windows95, and Irix
                  6.4. While Irix was found to give rather good
                  real-time performance, NT4 and Windows95 suffer from
                  both process scheduling delays and high audio output
                  latency. The addition of WDM Streaming to NT and
                  Windows offers some promise of lower latency, but
                  WDM Streaming may actually make performance worse by
                  circumventing priority-based
                  scheduling. 1. Introduction A modern CPU can run
                  extensive and sophisticated signal processing faster
                  than real time. Unfortunately, executing the right
                  code at the right time and performing time-critical
                  I/O may very well exceed the capabilities of a

	Abstract = {<SABS>The new Internet and mobile methods of
                  communications have changed the ways people
                  communicate and use language. In some cases,
                  information and communications technology, and
                  especially the Internet, have had a major effect on
                  use of the written languageabbreviations, new
                  methods of spelling, and methods of showing
                  emotions. Also, with the use of modern
                  communications technology, the way people interact
                  at a distance with language is shifting rapidly. The
                  premise of this work is that the Internet and mobile
                  technology have enabled several new forms of
                  communications that have radically changed how
                  people communicate with each other. These methods of
                  communication have allowed informal communication at
                  a distance rather than only face-to-face and in many
                  cases, virtually reduced distances.  In addition,
                  there are social implications that need to be
                  explored. This article introduces the concept of

	Abstract = {Pierre Schaeffer's reaction to his perception of ``concrete sounds'' was of fundamental importance to his later musical investigations. However, it is often dismissed as merely the promotion of explicitly anecdotal sound vocabularies drawn from the ``real-world''. This is a misconception which obscures the significance of Schaeffer's specifically musical researches; the term ``concrete'' becomes vague and its cultural and philosophical resonances remain concealed. Schaeffer realised that in the acousmatic environment of radio broadcasting ``real'', ``documentary'' sounds could be powerfully evocative, thereby transcending their causal origins. Subsequently, these experiences were refined as he examined how musical aspects might be extracted from any object in the sound universe. Thus investigations of musical language were actively promoted by techniques of radio production. Furthermore, anecdotal sounds encouraged a humanist dimension in Schaeffer's thinking: Man's reaction to the acoustic world when modulated by the transforming power of technology.},

                  variety of music in computer-accessible form. There
                  are primarily two kinds of music data: sampled audio
                  files and symbolic music representations,
                  essentially listing notes with pitch, onset time,
                  and duration for each note. Music audio is to
                  symbolic music as speech audio is to text. In each

@article{frisk05,
	Abstract = {In this article we discuss the notion of
                  "interaction", "participation" and "the public" in
                  artistic work, specifically within the context of
                  the exhibition The Invisible Landscapes (curated by
                  Miya Yoshida, Malmo Konstmuseum, 2003) and
                  etherSound (created by Henrik Frisk), a sound
                  installation displayed in that exhibition. In this
                  work the audience is invited to participate in the
                  creation of new sound events by sending text
                  messages from their mobile phones. Thus, our
                  discussion is focused on the space and the mode of
                  participation opened up by new communication
                  technology. Based on our experiences of that
                  project, we introduce and explain what we believe
                  are relations of creative production and a different
                  kind of creativity that may emerge from active
                  interaction. We also attempt to describe what we
                  believe an implementation of active public
                  participation can lead to. We are combining two
                  modes of thinking in this article; one is inspired
                  by a discourse of cultural theories and the other by
                  reflection on our experience of the event. The
                  latter is, by definition, rather subject centred and
                  expansive based on individual observation. We
                  examine and analyse the phenomenon of
                  "participation" whilst playing etherSound as a
                  process of creative production, and seek to reflect
                  upon the power of the co-operative practice and its
                  relation to participation and creativity. },

@article{gurtler05,
	Abstract = {My contribution intends to show that the traditional
                  philosophical concept of work (Marx, Hegel,
                  Kierkegaard, Marcuse, Arendt, Habermas, and the
                  rest) leaves out a crucial dimension. Work is
                  reduced, for example, to the interaction with
                  nature, the problem of recognition, or economic
                  self-preservation. But work also establishes an
                  ethical relation having to do with the needs of
                  others and to the common good, a view of work that
                  should be of particular interest for feminist and
                  gender philosophy. This dimension makes visible, as
                  socially necessary work, the so-called reproductive
                  sphere pertaining to giving birth and raising
                  children, but it also generalizes the aspect of
                  care, which plays a significant role in traditional
                  woman's work. The ethical relation to the other is a
                  characteristic feature of human work and in this
                  sense, the possibility of working is a part of a
                  good life. },

	Abstract = { Recent philosophical tendencies of ``Actor-Network
                  Theory,'' ``Object-Oriented Ontology,'' and
                  ``Speculative Realism'' have profoundly challenged the
                  centrality of subjectivity in the humanities, and
                  many artists and curators, particularly in the UK,
                  Germany, and the United States, appear deeply
                  influenced by this shift from epistemology to
                  ontology. October editors asked artists, historians,
                  and philosophers invested in these projects---from
                  Graham Harman and Alexander R. Galloway to Armen
                  Avanessian and Patricia Falgui{\`e}res to Ed Atkins and
                  Amie Siegel---to explore what the rewards and risks of
                  assigning agency to objects may be, and how, or if,
                  such new materialisms can be productive for making
                  and thinking about art today. },

	Abstract = {A common framework for studying perception and
                  performance in both human-technology interaction and
                  music is presented. The framework represents the
                  cognitive challenges faced by both musicians and
                  human operators in technological systems. In the
                  perceptual realm, both must infer distal or covert
                  states from proximally available information (e.g.,
                  inferring the emotional meaning of a musical
                  composition; inferring the functional meaning of
                  interface displays). In the realm of action, both
                  must select proximally available actions, or means,
                  to achieve distal ends or goals (e.g., a conductor
                  using hand movements to direct an orchestra, an
                  operator using interface controls to tune an
                  industrial process or respond to a fault). The
                  framework represents these proximal-distal relations
                  and enables quantitative measurement of the degree
                  to which performers adapt to them. The framework is
                  illustrated with a review of music and
                  human--technology interaction research and our own
                  study of the coordination between a professional
                  conductor's hand movements and a concertmaster's
                  bowing actions in the opening of Beethoven's Fifth
                  Symphony. In providing a common theoretical
                  framework for both music and engineering, we hope to
                  enhance prospects for research on group musical
                  performance to inspire novel, robust design models
                  for modern sociotechnical systems.},

However, both Theremin and his followers continued to experiment, teach and perform with the instrument throughout the greater part of the century. With the advent of perestroika came renewed interest in the theremin and in electronic music in general, a trend that has continued to date.},

@article{overton94,
	Abstract = {In this target article, I explore the thesis that
                  both the natural and human sciences are
                  undergoing-however gradually and reluctantly-a deep
                  and broad paradigm shift. This shift is away from
                  foundational, objectivist, atomist, nondirectional
                  mechanistic category systems and toward
                  interpretational, holistic, relational-dialectical,
                  directional organic category systems. The contextual
                  influence of each of these category systems on
                  understandings of change (development), cognition,
                  and personality is examined both historically and
                  from a contemporary perspective across a wide band
                  of scientific disciplines. The Arrow of Time is a
                  deep metaphor entailing a relational field of both
                  nonclosed cycles (spirals) and direction. The Arrow
                  of Time metaphor emerges from the organic
                  narrative. Within the context of this metaphor, and
                  the broader organic metaphor that forms the wider
                  conceptual context, development is understood as
                  entailing both direction and variation. Within the
                  organic metaphor, cognition and personality are
                  understood as emerging from a fundamentally
                  relational theory of the embodied mind. The Cycle of
                  Time is a deep metaphor of closed cycles that reduce
                  apparent directionality to nothing but
                  variation. The Cycle of Time emerges from the
                  mechanical narrative. Here development is understood
                  as being limited to variation and only variation,
                  and cognition and personality emerge from a theory
                  of the computational mind. Theoretical and
                  methodological implications of each of these broad
                  contextual narratives are discussed.},

@article{smithers:98,
	Abstract = {Van Gelder's clear distinction between the
                  quantitative nature of dynamical systems and the
                  nonquantitative nature of computational processes
                  provides a firm basis for distinguishing between
                  processes that happen in time and processes that
                  happen over time. Symbolic reasoning, the presumed
                  basis of intelligent behavior in robots, happens
                  over time. However, the movements and actions that
                  robots must make to behave intelligently, happen in
                  time. Attempting to connect the two, as classical
                  artificial intelligence and robotics have presumed
                  to be necessary, has produced a tension and an
                  arbitrarily moving interface in the construction of
                  robots. Adopting a robotic version of the dynamical
                  hypothesis offers sound theoretical and scientific
                  justification for those robotics researchers who
                  continue to insist that getting the interaction
                  dynamics of intelligent behavior right is a purely
                  dynamical matter, and never a symbolic computational
                  one.},

	Abstract = {The dynamical hypothesis is the claim that cognitive
                  agents are dynamical systems. It stands opposed to
                  the dominant computational hypothesis, the claim
                  that cognitive agents are digital computers. This
                  target article articulates the dynamical hypothesis
                  and defends it as an open empirical alternative to
                  the computational hypothesis. Carrying out these
                  objectives requires extensive clarification of the
                  conceptual terrain, with particular focus on the
                  relation of dynamical systems to computers. Key

                  dominant computational approach in cognitive science
                  is the hypothesis that cognitive agents are digital
                  computers; the heart of the alternative dynamical
                  approach is the hypothesis that cognitive agents are
                  dynamical systems. This target article attempts to

                  impersonal, and work centered. The first part

                  works of Julian Dodd, Peter Kivy, James O. Young,
                  Aron Edidin, and Stephen Davies. In the second part
                  of the article, I reject this received
                  view. Evidence from actual performance practice, as
                  well as from the practitioners' reflection on their
                  activity, belies the received view outlined in the
                  first part of the article. I conclude by drawing

  Abstract =	 {The article focuses on Peter Kivy's
                  "Authenticities," a book that he writes to
                  contradict the claim that historical authenticity is
                  a source of aesthetic good. The author tries to
                  expose Kivy's concept of historical authenticity. As
                  reflected in the book, Kivy allegedly characterizes
                  the art of performing compositions with style and
                  originality, the two factors which do differentiate
                  arrangers from arranging. He also claims that it is
                  always best to follow the composer's suggestions for
                  performance. He likewise adds that the principle of
                  Composer Knows Best (CKB) might be suggested by
                  common sense as a nonstarter. However, despite these
                  assertions found in the book, the author points out
                  the oddity why Kivy has neglected his own
                  characterization of artistry in performance.},

  Abstract =	 {Hans Huyssen, a contemporary South African composer
                  whose social consciousness is an essential facet of
                  his work, stresses the importance of period
                  performance practice as a rejuvenating and
                  significant movement within Western art
                  music. Regarding contemporary music as 'the period
                  music of our time', it is his conviction that period
                  performance practice and contemporary composition
                  share the same goal, and moreover that a synthesis
                  of their artistic ideals offers possibilities for
                  responding specifically to the intricate challenges
                  posed by the 'new' South African
                  multiculturalism. Recent international debates on
                  the nature of the Early Music Movement and
                  Historically Informed Performance Practice (HIPP)
                  have not yet entered into South African
                  musicological scholarship. Yet Huyssen is firmly
                  convinced that these need to become part both of
                  current local musicology, and of the great diversity
                  in South African art music's creative, reproductive
                  and reception contexts. This article, i},

  abstract =	 {Evaluative judgment—i.e., assessing to what degree a
                  stimulus is liked or disliked—is a fundamental
                  aspect of cognition, facilitating comparison and
                  choosing among alternatives, deciding, and
                  prioritizing actions. Neuroimaging studies have
                  shown that evaluative judgment involves the
                  projection of sensory information to the reward
                  circuit. To investigate whether evaluative judgments
                  are based on modality-specific or modality-general
                  attributes, we compared the extent to which balance,
                  contour, symmetry, and complexity affect liking
                  responses in the auditory and visual modalities. We
                  found no significant correlation for any of the four
                  attributes across sensory modalities, except for
                  contour. This suggests that evaluative judgments
                  primarily rely on modality-specific sensory
                  representations elaborated in the brain’s sensory
                  cortices and relayed to the reward circuit, rather
                  than abstract modality-general representations. The
                  individual traits art experience, openness to
                  experience, and desire for aesthetics were
                  associated with the extent to which design or
                  compositional attributes influenced liking, but
                  inconsistently across sensory modalities and
                  attributes, also suggesting modality-specific
                  influences.}

  abstract =	 {As a research field, NIME is characterised by a
                  plethora of design approaches, hardware, and
                  software technologies. Formed of an
                  interdisciplinary research community with divergent
                  end-goals, the diversity of aims, objectives,
                  methods, and outcomes is striking. Ranging from
                  expressive interfaces, to musicological concerns,
                  novel sensor technologies, and artificial
                  creativity, the research presented is heterogeneous,
                  distinct, and original.  The design of digital
                  instruments is very different from the making of
                  acoustic instruments, due to the bespoke traditions
                  and production environments of the disciplines
                  mentioned above, but notably also because of the
                  heightened epistemic dimension inscribed in the
                  materiality of digital systems. These new
                  materialities are often hardware and software
                  technologies manufactured for purposes other than
                  music. Without having to support established
                  traditions and relationships between the instrument
                  maker and the performer or composer, new digital
                  musical instruments often develop at the speed of
                  the computer?s technical culture, as opposed to the
                  slower evolution of more culturally engrained
                  acoustic instrument design.}

  Abstract =	 {This qualitative study examined constructs of
                  "expertise" in the domain of music with five groups
                  of handbell choirs, four of which were comprised of
                  individuals with mental retardation or developmental
                  disability. Subjects with mental retardation also
                  differed in their residential placements (home,
                  community, institutions) and level of developmental
                  disability. Information was obtained from direct
                  observation, videotapes, interviews with choir
                  directors, and a stimulated recall
                  procedure. Results are analyzed in terms of the
                  "central phenomenon" (the bell ringing event) and a
                  model of "socially shared expertise" comprised of
                  causal conditions, intervening variables,
                  strategies, and consequences. Discussion centers on
                  definitions of expertise, expertise as socially
                  shared cognition, distributing the cognitive load
                  through the group, situated practice, and
                  scaffolding. The paper concludes that the groups
                  with mental retardation differed from the control

                  Western knowledge.'Walter Mignolo, Duke UniversityTo
                  the colonized, the term'research'is conflated with
                  European colonialism; the ways in which academic
                  research has been implicated in the throes of
                  imperialism remains a painful memory. This essential
                  volume explores intersections of imperialism and
                  research - specifically, the ways in which
                  imperialism is embedded in disciplines of knowledge
                  and tradition as'regimes of truth.'Concepts such
                  as'discovery'and'claiming'are discussed and an
                  argument presented that the decolonization of
                  research methods will help to reclaim control over
                  indigenous ways of knowing and being. Now in its
                  eagerly awaited second edition, this bestselling
                  book has been substantially revised, with new
                  case-studies and examples and important additions on
                  new indigenous literature, the role of research in
                  indigenous struggles for social justice, which

  Abstract =	 {Standard narratives on the relationship between art
                  and urban development detail art networks as
                  connected to sources of dominant economic, social,
                  and cultural capital and complicit in gentrification
                  trends. This research challenges the conventional
                  model by investigating the relationship between
                  grassroots art spaces, tied to marginal and local
                  groups, and the political economy of development in
                  the Chicago neighborhood of Pilsen. Using mixed
                  methods, I investigate Do‐It‐Yourself and Latinx
                  artists to understand the construction and goals of
                  grassroots art organizations. Through their
                  engagements with cultural representations, space and
                  time, grassroots artists represent and amplify the
                  interests of marginal actors. By allying with
                  residents, community organizations and other art
                  spaces, grassroots artists form a social movement to
                  redefine the goals and usages of urban space. My
                  findings indicate that heterogeneous art networks
                  exist and grassroots art networks can influence
                  urban },

  Abstract =	 {Music appeals to more than just our sense of
                  hearing, and clearly we often associate other

                  music. Explorations of mental images of
                  music-related movement could enhance our
                  understanding of music as a phenomenon, as well as

                  with great detail, and possibly interpreted by
                  musicians and computers for performance. A sound
                  object is notated with regard to its spectral width,
                  density, centroid frequency, significant sound
                  components, modulation and amplitude envelope. It
                  can also have a spectrum reference. The symbols are
                  placed over a spectrum grand-staff with a frequency
                  scale to show each parameter both from a frequency

                  system for music regardless of sound sources,
                  acoustic or electronic. I propose a way to visually
                  represent the positions and movements of sound in
                  composition and analysis of music which in different
                  ways utilises space as a parameter. I address a
                  number of aspects of spatialised music to take into
                  account when defining a notation language for the
                  music. I suggest visually representing the room in
                  different ways depending on how the music relates to
                  the concept of space: as projections from the center
                  of a sphere for more structural work, or as
                  coordinates in a cubic room for works that depict a
                  physical or imagined space. I also show how these
                  descriptions of space are integrated with my
                  existing notation system. },

                  as close as possible to all the pitches already

                  these crystals seems to mirror the historical
                  development of pitch resources, including the shift
                  from Pythagorean to just intonation in the sixteenth
                  century. As the crystals continue to grow, they
                  imply the emergence of pitch structures in 'extended

  Abstract =     {Actor-Network Theory is a controversial social
                  theory. In no respect is this more so than the role
                  it 'gives' to nonhumans: nonhumans have agency, as
                  Latour provocatively puts it. This article aims to
                  interrogate the multiple layers of this declaration
                  to understand what it means to assert with
                  Actor-Network Theory that nonhumans exercise
                  agency. The article surveys a wide corpus of
                  statements by the position's leading figures and
                  emphasizes the wider methodological framework in
                  which these statements are embedded. With this work
                  done, readers will then be better placed to reject
                  or accept the Actor-Network position -understanding
                  more precisely what exactly it is at stake in this
                  decision.},

  Abstract =     {Representations of archaeology in media such as
                  films and television have been historically
                  problematic. Video-games, however, have taken these
                  depictions of archaeology and archaeologists to the
                  next level, not only allowing media consumers to
                  view unethical behaviors such as looting and site
                  destruction, but to participate in them, as willing
                  and complicit bad actors. In 2017, the video-game
                  industry reported a worldwide 36 billion US dollars
                  in consumer spending, with over 6 billion of that
                  spending occurring within the United Kingdom. In
                  order to confront the deep and growing ethical
                  implications for archaeology, this project turns a
                  spotlight onto two key areas of concern: video-game
                  players' perceptions and professional archaeological
                  practices. In the first instance, I seek to
                  understand whether depictions of archaeologists in
                  video-games impact player perceptions of
                  archaeologists as skilled professionals. This
                  research contributes to contextualizing the
                  relationship between r},

@article{Smith2015,
  Abstract =	 {This paper considers the structure of the ethical
                  subject found in Foucault's late works on ethics,
                  and gives an account of his two major ethical
                  concepts: "care of the self" and "aesthetics of
                  existence." The "care of the self," it is argued,
                  gives Foucault a way of conceptualising ethics which
                  does not rely on juridical categories, and which
                  does not conceive the ethical subject on the model
                  of substance. The "care of the self" entails an
                  understanding of the ethical subject as a process
                  which is always in a relation, specifically in a
                  relation to itself. Using his essay "What is an
                  Author," it is argued that the subject of the
                  "aesthetics of existence," like the author of a
                  text, is understood to be fully immanent to the
                  "object" which it is usually considered to be
                  opposed to and separated from. Rather than aiming at
                  a true expression of an "authentic" inner substance,
                  Foucault's "aesthetics of existence" leads instead
                  to practices of "creativity," whose form cannot be
                  given in ad},

                  the care of the self. What exactly is this ideal
                  that Foucault describes in his last two books? Do
                  these books represent a break or a continuation with
                  the earlier writings on knowledge and power? Most
                  important, I consider whether the care of the self
                  could ever be a significant ethical ideal given some
                  of the objections that have been raised against
                  Foucault's position. I also look at the care of the
                  self as the focus of Foucault's own views on
                  spiritual life. I argue that Foucault's later work
                  offers the basis for a secular or non-theistic
                  spirituality which is especially relevant today.},
