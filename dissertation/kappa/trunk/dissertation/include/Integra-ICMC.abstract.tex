\begin{abstract}
In this paper we describe a means of storing information about audio and message processing modules, which is not software specific. This information includes a module description, module instance data, and module implementation data. A novel XML file format and database schema are proposed, and we show how a newly developed library (libIntegra) can be used as a link between persistent storage on a networked server, and an existing software environment for audio. The library provides methods for instantiating and connecting modules in a given piece of software, and addressing them using Open Sound Control (OSC) messaging.
