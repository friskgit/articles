This piece has been worked out in a close collaboration with the Swedish guitarist Stefan \"{O}stersj\"{o} for whom the piece is written. The very intention was to create a framework within which \"{O}stersj\"{o} could re-interpret the ideas behind the score in every performance. And in which every performance would contain all other performances. Its foundation is the interactions between the three musical characters that are sketched out in the score. It is precisely this interaction that \"{O}stersj\"{o} can alter according to the feedback he is getting from the computer part and according to his own likings. \emph{Repetition Repeats all other Repetitions} is a work in progress and is a project that will continue to develop.
