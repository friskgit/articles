\label{sec:repr-docum-artef}

If the artistic work is a container of experience, of time coded information, how can this experience be untangled, shared and evaluated by the researcher and by the researching community? The Western tradition has developed musicological methods to do this with tools such as music theory and musical notation but these are, to some degree, leaning on \emph{visual} representations of the sounding object, of its notation and its description---in principle second hand information. What methods and techniques do we have at our disposal, or what tools need to be invented, in order to work with the object itself rather than its representation?
