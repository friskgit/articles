\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\noindent

This chapter discusses the challenges related to arts based research in and through time-based artistic expressions. Even though many of the examples referenced in this chapter belong to the field of musical practice, the issues and challenges they intend to highlight are obviously common to several other real-time scenic and performing art forms. Even art expressions that are not easily associated with the real-time processes of music (e.g. painting, directing, design, etc. as well as hybrid forms converging artistic and technological thinking such as computer-game design and design of multi-user interactive environments), may in fact prove to have much in common with the time-based art forms. 

Although few art forms are unanimously non-real time or real-time, a distinction used below is that between artistic practices that are \emph{embedded in time} (in-time processes) and those that are \emph{contained in time} (over-time processes).\footnote{I am indebted the in-time versus over-time terminology to Vijay \citet{iyer08} who is referring to it in a discussion on embodiment in improvisation. For the original source along with a few additional on the topic of robotics and cognitive science, see \citet{smithers96,smithers:98,vangelder98}.} For an action to be embedded in time means that the time it takes to perform it matters; that time is a factor whose value is decisive. For example, the difference between reading or writing a book in one day or to do it in one year is not necessarily a difference that changes the meaning or expression of the book, whereas the time it takes to play or listen to a piece of music has everything to do with its expressive qualities: playing the same piece of music in ten minutes or in two hours is likely to make it a very different experience. For this reason it is argued here that there is a difference between a reflection upon the research object as a whole (outside time) and a reflection on the research object as it unfolds in time and the researcher engaged in arts based research in the real-time arts should embrace and investigate the in-time properties of the research object. Questions relating to the documentation and dissemination of in-time insights are further discussed and a point is made that the outcome of an arts based research that investigates the complex feedback loops in the time-based arts may be of interest also outside the art world. 

% In the real-time arts, how may these in-time processes be discussed in a fruitful manner, and how can their relations to the `object' of research be understood? What is the relation between the performer's in-time processes and that of the listeners/viewers? If the practice is embedded in time, as an in-time process, what actually consititutes the object of research?

The fact that in music \emph{action} takes place \emph{in} and \emph{through} real time rather than primarily \emph{over} time makes it an interesting, and equally difficult, candidate for artistic research. To gain access to whatever information may be hidden in its in-time properties the researcher needs to resist the temptation of falling back on the investigation of the over-time and out-of-time representations of the art work, such as musical scores, manuscripts, transcriptions, etc. Although most musical expressions offer the same temporal complexity, in the practice of Interactive Music, which is briefly discussed in the first section, the man-machine interactions surfaces the in-time aspects of music in a particularly useful way. As an hint at the compound nature of time a brief overview of temporal multiplicities is given and further on the artistic practice of the author is used to exemplify the research process from within the musical flow and the feedback between the different aspects of the practice. Finally, turning to Bergson's important writing on memory, it is suggested that even the in-memory (virtual) representation of in-time processes contain and depend on time.

\section*{Virtuality and Interaction}
\label{sec:why-interaction}

Both of the two main concepts here, virtuality and interaction, are nested with difficult and sometimes contradictory meanings and connotations. Although they do have significance also outside the field of human-computer interaction this short essay is not the place for an in depth discussion of all of their readings. In the following I will primarily use them as they are understood and used in the context of human-computer interaction in artistic practice. 

\subsection*{Virtual Reality}
\label{sec:virtual-reality}

When the technology became usable in the early 90's, Virtual Reality was seen as a great potential for art production. (See for example \citet{moser96,wood98,dixon07}) Virtual Reality is a game of deception where there is no extension in space (although there appears to be one) and where existence depends entirely on the interactions between the subject and the Virtual Reality technology. The virtual is disembodied and lacks a general visual component: the fact that users are able to mold their own (virtual) visuality is, after all, one of its great qualities.\footnote{Compare to William Gibson's famous definition of Cyberspace as a ``consensual hallucination'' \citep[51]{gibson84}} This visuality may be different each time, or, it may be identical to any other visuality, since making duplicates is no problem in the digital realm of the virtual. As technolgy has advanced its positions in Western culture, the virtual is nearly ubiquitous. To define a Virtual Reality that is distinct from \emph{reality} is almost not possible, because there is a virtual aspect to nearly all activities in the occidental World. \citep[See][]{baudrillard02:screened,frisk08} Central to the concept of Virtual Reality is the interface through which the user is able to \emph{interact} with the technology and the virtual worlds contained in it but the aspect of interaction in the field of interactive art and media is problematic as the term \emph{interactive} to some extent has been hijacked by computer interface designers.\footnote{Susan Kozel similarly comments how the meaning of the word `virtual' is to be found when its ``overly reductive association with immersive technologies and that now anachronistic term cyberspace'' is removed.} Though one of its lexicographic meanings is ``Reciprocally active'',\footnote{``interactive, \textit{a}.'' The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. 1 Nov. 2007. \url{http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50118746}} its meaning in the context of computer interface design is more geared towards a methodology of control, than sharing, or mutual exchange; aspects that are central to any human-human interaction. In the reduced meaning of computer interaction the actions of one part, the user, are controlling \emph{re}actions in the virtual world, often in a one-to-one relation: one action, one re-action. Ethnologist and cultural analyst Robert \citet{willim06} looks at the simplified user interfaces of much technology as a means to bring lucidity to sometimes extremely complex systems such as the internet or networked computer games. Habit formation and predictability brings order to an incomprehensible virtual world where a mouse click on a given icon on a computer desktop is expected to result in the same machine response, regardless of the user's preceding activities. Interaction in the context of the real-time arts, however, itself a highly complex system in which actions and responses flow back and forth in constantly shifting feedback loops, is rarely about one-to-one mappings, habit formation or predictability, and artistic interaction is not easily transformed to fit the reduced idea of interaction that technology typically offers. Hence, artistic practice is in need of novel approaches to interface design that allow for an extended view on interaction and this need may fuel both the practice itself as well as the development of computer interface design.


% In this kind of reduced interaction, a reaction to any given action is ignorant to any prior actions or reactions.
% Musical interaction, on the other hand, is all about reciprocity, particularly in improvised music. \citep[See for example][]{monson96} A successful interplay between musicians involved in an improvisation rests on a mutual sensitivity for taking, and responding to, musical initiatives. Musicians induce differences rather than alter states; they induce differences that ``\emph{make a difference}''. \footnote{And, according to Gregory Bateson, a difference that makes a difference is the definition of \emph{Information}]\citep[92]{Bateson}} 

The virtual world offered to us by modern technology is interesting both in the ways that it connects art and art practice to other research disciplines such as computer science and artificial intelligence in the ways described above, but also in the way that it deviates from the real world. Due to their ignorance of conventions and lack of long term memory, machines are phenomenal individual forgetting devices \citep{miller04} and the absence of an embodied relation between the machine and its operator is consolidating the breach between human cultural heritage and the agnostic nature of the machine. In the virtual world, beneath the predictability of the interface, nothing is hard wired, hence, muscular memory is useless: Any one physical movement can have a different meaning each time. % \footnote{The synthesizer is the perfect example here: Though it looks like a piano keyboard, any key can produce any imaginable (machine) sound, and a different one each time, all depending on how the synthesizer engine is programmed. Hence, any physical, embodied knowledge a trained pianist has with regard to sound production is virtually useless while playing a synthesizer or a keyboard attached to a computer instrument.} 
Envision the four members of the German pop-group Kraftwerk, % \footnote{See \url{http://kraftwerk.technopop.com.br/pictures\_80years.php} for some pictures from live concerts, in particular the image from the TV show `Na Sowas' from 1982 is significant.} 
standing still and expressionless in front of their keyboards (obviously exploiting this dissociate aspect of their relation to the machine-instrument). Compare this vision to the physicality of almost any acoustic instrument performer playing live in front of an audience. In an attempt to avoid the temporal and corporeal split between the technology and performer (between body and machine) so particular and well exploited by Kraftwerk, many artists working with computer technology have found ways to circumvent the missing physicality in their virtual tools, either by designing interfaces that allows for more dynamic modes of interaction, or by designing software that models or emulates a sense of embodiment. These efforts derive from the interactive needs of the real-time arts and lead to initiatives and inventions that may inform both the artistic practice as well as our thinking about human-computer interaction; that changes the object of research as well as its context but which also impacts a much wider scope. The lack of context particular to the virtuality of electronic art---digital tools may be infinitely updated and revised after which integral aspects of their original version have been altered and any knowledge related to their earlier edition may have become obsolete---is in this sense an asset in the ways that it forces the researcher to constantly rethink his or her practice.\footnote{That this may equally well be a frustration is described in \citet{ostertag02}).} At best it enables novel approaches to artistic problems or issues  but, it may equally well participate in creating expressions void of inter-musical (or inter-artistic) references. Approaching this field as a researching musician is a difficult task and the scientific as well as the social and cultural aspects of the virtual should be taken into consideration. % How can the spaces of the virtual be truthfully represented outside of their own domain? How may they be documented and communicated in the context of arts based research? 
% Is there a place for the listener/viewer in the virtual improvisation where the interactions between performer and instrument(s) are not necessarily obvious?

\subsection*{Interactive Music}
\label{sec:interactive-music}

Interactive music may be seen as the musical representation of Virtual Reality technology. It is a music that involves technology and where the responses from this technology are depicted by real-time stimuli from human and/or virtual performers. The intricacy of the dynamics in the relationship between the man and the machine is of particular interest while working with interactive music and as a sub-genre of computer music, it is interdisciplinary by nature \citep[24]{moore90}. In the context of arts based research it is obviously important to draw upon knowledge that emanates from related fields of inquiry but it is equally important to re-evaluate those same sources. Historically there may have been a tendency for computer music to lean against the natural sciences in a way that has hindered the development of the artistic and humanistic aspects of this genre and for the researcher engaged in arts based research it is important to remember that the primary purpose of the research should not be to manifest theories external to the field of research but to also critically examine and question the related sciences. Though there may be modes of thinking that correspond to and overlap with the practice, owing to the nature of artistic practice, there will surely be aspects that deviate from it. The concept of time, and the idea of music and other time-based art forms as being embedded in time, is one mode of thinking that leads away from the more traditional scientific methods in the way that the interactions between the artist(s) and the object of research is subject to constant change.

Much (but not all) of art production, as well as most other abstract operations, at least in its early stages, are over-time activities. Painting a picture, conceptualizing an art installation or writing a musical score are (roughly speaking) over-time operations even if the result, or the instantiation of these art works may be in-time operations. The American art critic Harold Rosenberg, in a discussion of the aesthetics of impermanence, discusses the art work as an ``interval in the life of both artist and spectator'' and continues: ``Compositions into which found objets are glued or affixed of from which they protrude or are suspended make art subject to time on equal terms with nature and commodities for daily use.'' \citep[92]{rosenberg66} Further on Rosenberg turns to action painting where the art object is ``abandoned altogether'', replaced by a single act of creation: ``composition turns literally to an event.'' \citep[93]{rosenberg66} In this final example we could truly speak of visual arts as an in-time process, although this process is nullified as soon as the result of the event, the canvas, is exhibited as an art work independent of its mode of creation.

% The concept of time in general and the in-time aspect of music in particular. 

% If the practice is embedded in time, as an in-time process, what actually consititutes the object of research?

 % and, considering the great challenges computer interface designers are facing, expanding our knowledge on the nature of this relationship within the artistic practice may yield results that prove to be valid also outside that domain. Particularly so as advanced digital computer technology is constantly expanding its horizons with a flood of new objects and gadgets for which the interactive needs are not necessarily known in advance. 

% Meanwhile, 
% In the context of Interactive Music, the dissimilarity in the way in which man and machine deal with time and memory, may easily disrupt the performer as well as the researcher. Again, as \emph{forgetting devices} machines allow for a detached attitude towards history and cultural heritage and as such, they participate in the creation of novel artistic expressions. 

% Musical performance and improvisation are typical in-time operations: They are \emph{embedded in time} (to use \citeauthor{smithers96} expression) whereas over-time operations may be said to be \emph{contained in time}. Along with advances in computer science and robotics, real time computation has altered the picture somewhat, but the distinction between an over-time operation being so fast that time goes unnoticed is very different from the way the mind ``exploits both the constraints and allowances of the natural timescales of the body and the brain as a total physical system.'' \citep[276]{iyer08} The in-time versus over-time distinction is interesting with regard to the topic of time and temporality, but it is also of interest to the specific topic of Interactive music. As a genre, Interactive music (as was noted above) descend from Computer Music, also called Electro-acoustic music, and has strong interdisciplinary connections with subject areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science and Computer Science. \citep[24]{moore90} These disciplines are concerned with trying to understand human behavior and, to some extent, attempt to mimic that behavior in machines. In the context of arts based research it is important to draw upon knowledge that emanates from related fields of inquiry but it is equally important to re-evaluate those same sources. Historically there may have been a tendency for Computer music to lean against the natural sciences that, in fact, may also have much to gain from learning from the artistic practice of Computer music, or other artistic practices. The concept of time in general and the in-time aspect of music in particular. For the researcher engaged in arts based research it is important to remember that the primary purpose of the research should not only be to manifest theories external to the field of research but also critically examine and question the related sciences. What modes of thinking correspond to the practice and what ideas deviate from it? If the practice is embedded in time, as an in-time process, what actually consititutes the object of research?

It is possible in the example above to link together the action to the object and look at the canvas as a carrier of the (in-time) action that gave rise to it and argue that research carried out with reference to this canvas may also include the action and temporalities that were part of its creation. When dealing with real-time art forms with or without technology, however, it is much more difficult to unanimously distinguish the object. The music that is a result of real-time processes such as improvisation, live coding, interpretation, etc., is made up of a volatile substance that is not easily transformed to a researchable entity. While investigating how the virtual sound worlds of computer instruments, created and edited in real-time, may interact with (or fail at interacting with) the real world, the questions pertaining to access and documentation will become important. Although the Western tradition has developed powerful musicological methods to represent and document music visually, \citep{bregman94} independent of time, are there methods that retain the temporal identity of the object rather than do away with it? Video recordings of performances is a practicable method commonly used but it is important to remember that, as opposed to the canvas above, a recording is a representation of the object and not the object itself.

% Such methods should, ultimately, also include questions only rarely explored in arts based research, such as the impact of contextuality and listener reception in musical and scenic performances. 
% Also more multi-disciplinary research projects will be of great interest here, in particular those that actively deal with visuality in different forms such as computer games and film. 


% \subsection*{Interaction}
% \label{sec:interaction}


% The aspect of interaction in the field of interactive art and media is problematic as the term \emph{interactive} to some extent has been hijacked by computer interface designers.\footnote{Susan Kozel similarly comments how the meaning of the word `virtual' is to be found when its ``overly reductive association with immersive technologies and that now anachronistic term cyberspace'' is removed.} Though one of its lexicographic meanings is ``Reciprocally active'',\footnote{``interactive, \textit{a}.'' The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. 1 Nov. 2007. \url{http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50118746}} its meaning in the context of computer interface design is more geared towards a methodology of control, than sharing, or mutual exchange. In the reduced meaning of computer interaction the actions of one part, `the user', is used to control the \emph{re}actions of the other, `the machine', often in a one-to-one relation: one action, one re-action. In this kind of reduced interaction, a reaction to any given action is ignorant to any prior actions or reactions. A mouse click on a given icon on a computer desktop typically results in the same machine response, regardless of the user's preceding activities. Musical interaction, on the other hand, is all about reciprocity, particularly in improvised music. \citep[See for example][]{monson96} A successful interplay between musicians involved in an improvisation rests on a mutual sensitivity for taking, and responding to, musical initiatives. Musicians induce differences rather than alter states; they induce differences that ``\emph{make a difference}''. \footnote{And, according to Gregory Bateson, a difference that makes a difference is the definition of \emph{Information}]\citep[92]{Bateson}} 
% Even for an orchestra conductor---who is commonly seen as the \emph{director} of the music, commanding its flow---the agency of control is limited to what can be achieved through interaction with the musicians in the orchestra. Interaction-as-control and interaction-as-difference are not clear cut definitions in binary opposition. Again we are dealing with a continuum; a continuum of interactive potential ranging from the most reduced form of interaction-as-control (click and response) to the infinitely complex interaction-as-difference (e.g. human interaction, musical interaction, performer/audience interaction). 
% The activity of playing back a CD-recording of a symphony on a sound system is an example of the former while conducting a symphony orchestra playing the same symphony is an (extreme) example of latter. What one may gain in control with the CD player, the recording and the sound system---a CD can be paused, repeated, removed, etc.---we loose in influence over content. 
% As conductors we may alter the music in ways that we see fit, limited merely by cultural and social practices. But what we gain in influence in this context we loose in control: We can not as easily pause a live performance, considerable financial resources needs to be deployed in order to gather all the musicians needed, the training needed to be able to conduct a symphony orchestra is counted in years whereas the training needed to play back a CD is counted in seconds, etc. While engaging in practice based research within the framework of a real time art form the researcher should embrace the temporal complexity of the artistic practice: What are the differences that makes a difference?

\section*{Time and multi temporality}
\label{sec:performing-time}

As was stated above, performing music, as well as performance in other time based art forms, takes place \emph{in} time, and I believe it is fair to assume that in these cases there is a difference between investigating `the object'\footnote{Let the object, for the moment, encompass all and any aspects of the artistic practice.} in-time, while it is unfolding, as opposed to doing it over-time. Hence, the researching artist in these disciplines, needs to be able to explore the object in a multifaceted way, as a stratum of analytical modes in simultaneous operation, some of which are performed in real-time and some that are performed in non-real-time, accessing the object through documentations of the performance. The question of time is significant as many of these simultaneous processes take place in different time scales or temporal modes. % For example, while performing, the musician measures the perceived sound against an inner vision of what was intended, and against prior performances, and this evaluation is constantly performed at different rates, different temporal resolutions. 
Orchestra conductors are making judgments on the music in the present based on their knowledge and expectation of what will happen in the future of the music: in next bar, the next section, the next movement, the end of the concert, the next concert, etc. They are able to constantly keep a fish eye view on the piece without loosing the details in the process. % The conductor is accessing the object at different rates and at different temporal locations, or points in history (and in the future), all at the same time.
As is pointed out by \citet{dixon07} ``theory and criticism in digital arts and performance, as well as artist's own self-reflections, are replete with explanations and analyses of how works `explore,' `challenge,' `reconfigure,' or `disrupt' notions of time'' (p. 522) but the temporalities referred to here are not simply disrupting another temporality (although they do that too), nor do they easily fit into one single ``extratemporal'' category as is suggested by Dixon. They co-exist and operate in parallel to any other temporalities present.
The ability to simultaneously act in multiple temporalities is not unique to performing artists. It is something we constantly do to various degrees in every day life, but because of the ways in which different temporal and interactive modes unfold in the real-time arts, arts based research may provide unique insights into this complex area.

% A number of composers and theorists have stressed the multiplicity of temporal modes present in music and the American electronic music composers Curtis Roads makes the interesting remark that the discontinuities that appear in the boundaries between different time scales gives rise to perceptual differences in sonic events. \citep[4]{roads}  A note terribly out of tune in one temporal order may have just the right intonation in another, and a beat out of sync in one time scale may swing in another. \citep[For an example of the great variation in rhythmic timing among jazz musicians when observed at high temporal resolution, see][]{friberg02} 

%To the Greek composer and architect Iannis Xenakis the discontinuity of time was of pivotal import. Not only the interruptions that occur when moving across the boundaries between different temporal scales, but also the separability of events occurring within the flux of one particular time scale. 

To the Greek composer and architect Iannis Xenakis the question of time was of great importance. His views, most likely influenced by his work as an architect, are used here as a backdrop for the ideas of time, memory and temporality discussed later in this chapter. According to \citet{xenakis71}, non-synchronicity and discontinuity of events in time is what makes the flux of time perceptible: without it time would remain hidden, illegible and inapproachable. % Painting a picture of chains of events that makes time come forward, Xenakis also argues that their representation in the brain---our memory of events in time---is a generalization and abstraction that exists outside of time: ``Memory is the spatial translation of temporal (causal) chains.'' \citep[263]{xenakis71} 
% Contiguous events, separate in time, creates durations in the flux of time and marks out spatial distances in its memory representation: Time becomes space. Following this line of thought, music is an art form that, in most cases, participates in space as part of a temporal flux. It lays out events in the flow of time, a flow which in itself, in some cases, is controlled by these events.
Xenakis is also arguing, however, that the same music may exist outside of time, as a snapshot, as an abstract representation. This representation, when encoded in our memories, or when described as a musical structure (e.g. a fugue), becomes accessible to us as a whole. A whole which we can navigate, jump back and forth in, and sustain at random access. The whole becomes, not a succession, but something non-temporal that ``can be viewed as one \emph{time spectrum} of a fundamental duration'' \citep[73, my italics.]{roads}.\footnote{See also \citet{stockhausen57}}
This is comparable to the transformation from event to object that was discussed above with regard to action painting and according to this line of thought, even though the activities that lead to the creation of an art work were embedded in time, and entirely dependent on time, another transformation, perhaps an ontological one, forces the art work into its out-of-time representation. That the ``chief attribute of a work of art in our century (the 20th century, my remark) is not stillness but circulation'' \citep[93]{rosenberg66} does not make a decisive difference in this context, as that circulation (in most cases) is an over-time process rather than an in-time process.

That in-time processes such as music are transformed to `image-representations', or get transformed to their out-of-time representations in the consciousness of performers or audiences, is a common thought that rests on the idea that also a performance work may be seen as an object; in essence, this is also an ontological construct. 
%The time spectrum mentioned above transforms events in time to events in `space', and the reverse transforms `spatial' properties in events to temporal properties. 
%Thoughts like these may seem speculative; as abstract constructs induced on top of an artistic expression, but when, and if, they are the result of a research performed from within the artistic practice, they may carry with them novel ideas, specifically about the concept of musical time, but also with regard to time and memory in general. Furthermore, these ideas may be positioned against other real time as well as non-real time art practices in which the relation between time and space is of a different order. % The musical score is a means of rendering events embedded in time in space. It is a document that, according to some ontologies, constitute the musical work. Does Xenakis' space spectrum move beyond the idea of the musical transcription?
Xenakis' idea of musical memory as a spatial translation of the musical events contained in it should probably be traced to his background as an architect, and may have been influenced by his aptitude and sensibility for spatial rendering. If we limit ourselves to the realm of the time based arts, is it really possible that our in memory representation of something such as music, that exists and evolves in time, can be represented \emph{independent} of time? And if it is, what is the coupling between time and space that makes the transformations from one to the other transparent; how is the space/time spectrum calculated? These are examples of questions that may be tackled from within an artistic practice in the context of arts based research. Only from within the flow of time is it possible to fully grasp the time-space transformations and their significances, specifically as well as generally. Xenakis' book \emph{Formalized Music} is an interesting example of an early practice based research project and a document of a composer's view on questions such as time and temporality in music and they are interesting precisely because of Xenakis' strong relation to the spatial dimensions. % However, the results of an interrogation performed from within the flow of time, may well yield a very different result from those arrived at by Xenakis. 

 % likely to be different from those obtained from the outside, and hence they have the potential to contribute new knowledge to several fields if inquiry.

% In music, many different time scales are active, influential and % operative simultaneously and it is possible, for the listener as well % as for the performer, to move between them. Although it is true that % this movement alters the listeners perceptions, the moving between % timescales and the coexistance of multiple timescales is also possible % without the discontinuity brought up by \citeauthor{roads} above. 

\section*{Performing in practice}
\label{sec:performing-practice}

Something that is embedded in time will always be difficult---but not impossible--to conceive of as an object (though object is a misleading term here), independent of its temporal context. Despite Xenakis' argument to the contrary, I will argue that this `object' will not easily transform itself to a spatial representation, mainly because in the real-time arts it is not just the order of the events and the speed at which they are deployed that matters and that gives this object its character. As important are the many interactions between the many different agents that play a part in the construction of the in-time event. The performer/researcher working in the field of arts based research should resist the temptation of objectifying the in-time performance and instead embrace the possibilities and the great challenges that lies in investigating the in-the-moment, unfolding, real-time, processes of creative and interactive activities. Their in-time aspects, such as their physicality, and inter-subjectivity, are primarily accessible from the inside, from within the creative activity and they will risk at loosing their identity if they are instead looked upon as over-time processes, resolved of their `in-timeness'. Performing research in-time is a difficult task but for arts based research in time based arts to be different from e.g. standard musicological research, the practitioner and researcher has to face these difficulties and attempt to access the object from the inside. The means to do it and the methods to use will inevitably have to differ depending on the practice but investigating and acknowledging the differences between divergent temporal domains and temporalities is a prerequisite, regardless of the discipline. In other words, to engage in arts based research, accessing the object of research as an in-time process constitutes an activity that may offer an interesting alternative to the otherwise dominating visual modes of research expressions. % Discussing the practice of an improvising musician without resorting (solely) on transcriptions of the performances, or other abstract representations, is likely to render a result different from traditional musicological research, or arts based research that primarily takes place outside the temporal flow of the object.
To visualize a flow of time, i.e. to perform the kind of time spectrum transformation as was suggested by Xenakis above, is admittedly a powerful and pedagogical conjuration % \footnote{A popular example is the famous scene in Hitchcock's 1959 movie \emph{Vertigo}. Madeleine (played by Kim Novak), whose identity is overwhelmed by her great grand-mother, is standing in front of a cross section of an over 1000 years old Redwood tree. She places her finger towards the outer ring of the tree and marks out the point where she was born and the point where she died. The distance between the two points is short relative to the size of the tree, and, as she is moving her finger across the wood, she says ``It was only a moment to you''. \cite{hitchcock59} The cross section of the tree is used to spatialize a (short) life span, to transform a duration to a distance, to transform time to space. Another, similarly schizophrenic, example is the end of the first act of Richard Wagner's opera Parsifal (cited above) where there is a slightly more subtle and continuous transformation from time to space. Parsifal makes a remark that, despite his slow pace he already seem to have come far. The explanation offered to him is that ``time here becomes space''. \cite[See][act 1]{wagner82}}
but it is equally deceptive: it is a transformation of an in-time process to an over-time process, and in the shift, temporal, interactive, as well as other kinds of information is bound to get lost.

% These depend on properties that will not transform themselves to out-of-time representations without something substantial being lost.

\subsection*{Performing reflections}
\label{sec:perf-refl}

As a performer, engaged in an actual performance with an interactive computer system, and simultaneously a researcher, I combine several different roles and disseminating processes at once. As can be drawn from the graphic in Figure \ref{fig:player-comp} I at once access and evaluate the object in different modes of thinking relating to the different tasks I carry out, or have carried out in preparation for the performance (as a programmer, a musician, a composer, etc.). The object in this case is simplified to constitute the bare audible trace left by what I and the computer produce together. Similar to how it was noted with regard to the conductor above, the evaluation is simultaneously done at different rates and against different inner `templates', expectations or value judgments (of which some may be upright banal): Is this note in tune? Is this good music? Does this work against the pre-conceived form? Is this computer programme functioning the way it should? Will this work in the next concert? 

Apart from the performance specific reflections, in arts based research there is the additional layer of the research activity. In my own experience the point of intersection, the convergence, between the in-time music and the research upon that process, is an area laborious to navigate wisely and honestly.\footnote{At a seminar in Gothenburg University October 20, 2004, Mika Hannula spoke about the great import of \emph{protection}: The institutions need to protect their PhD candidates in the (general) field of arts based research (basically from themselves) due to the difficulties that lies in the creator/researcher intersection. The title of Hannula's presentation was ``What are we talking about when we we talk about artistic research?''} It is easy to get lost and it is easy to get drawn outside of the temporal flux so particular to musical practice. It is always tempting to detach the research from the in-time process and let it operate in its own temporal mode, more closely related to how musicological activities are carried out. Intimidating questions relating to the validity of a research performed from within \emph{bad} art (i.e. bad art but good research) makes the task even more difficult for the researcher. (If at all possible, no artist researcher will ever be proud to have performed excellent research but bad art.) However, many of these distracting questions relate to the (false) idea that the researcher could somehow be discrete from the performer, as if a Cartesian split between the rational investigator and the unpredictable creator was possible and desirable. 

\begin{figure}[htb]

  \caption{\small{A modified version of the previous graph (see Figure \ref{fig:player-comp}) where the listeners and the performer are united in the act of listening. A linear conception of a producer and a group of consumers is reduced in favor of a distributed sphere of listening.}}
  \label{fig:player-comp-2}
\end{figure}

In the graph representing a slice of time of a performance (Figure \ref{fig:player-comp}), the trajectories of reflection create a feedback loop between the object of research and the musician and a corresponding loop may be found in between the listeners and the music, representing the listener's reflections upon that same music as it takes place in real time. Although not likely to be entirely synchronous with those of the performer, provided the performer and the listeners share some musical references or have a common cultural ground, it is conceivable that some of the reflections made by the listeners overlap with some of the performer's. It is as a listener I (as a performer) am able to reflect on that which I play and in that sense the audible trace, although produced by me, is a shared object of reflection for both myself and the listeners. 

In this view of our interactions the producer-consumer conception of performer-listener is resolved in favour of a relation more geared towards an  inter-subjectivity. Marcel \citeauthor{cobussen08}, in his book \emph{Thresholds: Rethinking Sprituality in Music}, discusses listening and suggests an understanding of ``listening to music'' that really means ``listening \emph{to and fro} music''. \citep[135 (italics by the author)]{cobussen08} When experienced, this oscillating movement of coming and going moves beyond the the idea of the listening subject and the sounding object. According to \citeauthor{cobussen08}, ``to listen to and fro decenters them, wipes them out.'' (\emph{ibid.}) Through the shared act of listening the subject-object divide between the listener and the sounding object is erased, and the producer-consumer distinction between the performer and the listener is blurred. 
If the performer is a listener among other listeners, the traditional view on a flow of communication from a creator to a listening subject indeed becomes difficult to maintain. Instead we may consider the image of a group of listeners in which some members are \emph{also} performers and creators (Figure \ref{fig:player-comp-2}). % I am not a performer that listens, I am a listener among other listeners that also performs. 

\subsection*{Interaction and feedback}
\label{sec:interaction-feedback}

According to improviser Vijay \citeauthor{iyer08} the sense of ``shared time'' is an important property of music listening and is a crucial aspect of musical improvisation. Listening to a performance of improvised music is to experience the improvisers real-time struggles, their in-time processes. Also to non-dance oriented music, listening to music is a co-performance, a ``participatory act of marking musical time with rhythmic bodily activity [which] physicalizes the sense of shared time, and could be viewed as embodied listening.'' \citep[276]{iyer08} Both in Cobussen's and Iyer's accounts, the interactions between the agents at play (listeners, performers, creators, etc.) are central. Not only what happens at each end of the flights of communication between the agents involved, but what happens also in the continuum \emph{between} them. Applied to the context of arts based research this would mean to complement introspective reflections and reflections on the object with an investigation of what goes on in the interactions with the listeners/viewers, the technology in use, other performers, or with any other zones that influences the artistic practice.\footnote{Cf Chapter 11, in which the described project Bodies in Flight describes the contemporary human as \emph{an interstices in-between} various discursive fields and their related
technologies.} % Furthermore, in the case of the time based arts, the temporalities of these interactions should be taken into account. The order of events as well as the temporal potential and prerequisites within the system(s) of interaction. (The temporality of the computer in Figure \ref{fig:player-comp} and \ref{fig:player-comp-2} is in every respect different from that of the listeners in the same figures.)
Before looking at the aspect of multi-temporality within these interactions, however, I will briefly return to the nature of the in-time reflections in the imagined performance sketched in Figure \ref{fig:player-comp}.

In the interactions and feedback loops between the performer and the audible trace in Figures \ref{fig:player-comp} and \ref{fig:player-comp-2}, it is difficult to separate artistic evaluations and reflections from those that are research oriented. Or, perhaps more accurately described, also a research oriented reflection may very well result in an alteration of the object, an alteration that changes the output. The in-time research oriented reflection resists the theory versus practice divide in that it operates in parallel to the practice, and in that it undoubtedly also has an impact on that upon which it reflects.\footnote{Also compare to how Susanne Kozel earlier in this volume writes that ``innate to performance is the ability to reflect on what we are doing while we are doing it. I practice, and I reflect upon practice in infinitesimal loops.'' (Chapter 8, section 3, \S3} Not all art practice is arts based research but all arts based research performed in-time in the ways described here will alter the artistic expression in some respect. Furthermore, the research activity may constitute meta-reflection, reflections upon purely musical reflections (e.g. \emph{Why is it important that this note is in tune?}) forming compound reflections of both artistic and research oriented nature further influencing the present and future expressive qualities of the creative work. In other words, although the trajectories of reflection may be distinct from one another, their responses are not. % This is conceptually different from an arts based research contained in time since the latter can `stop' a process and give time for a reflection and then `restart' the process again.
% Furthermore, the out-of-time reflection of an artistic process is not likely to change the object in the ways described here as in this phase we have left the producing stage.

% This approach is different from one 

% \subsection*{Programming computers}
% \label{sec:progr-comp}

% This perceptual non-linearity between cause and effect can also be found in the sometimes asymmetrical communications between a performer, an interactive computer system, and listeners. Imagine a performance where the computer `listens' to the performer and responds to a given set of triggers (a particular note, a gesture, a rhythm, etc.). Imagine further that in the performance the system fails at recognizing a particular trigger, with the effect that the desired response is not achieved. This `mistake' is likely to alter the music. Not only because the desired response was not triggered, but also because the performer, in response to the missed cue, may alter the playing in order to facilitate the computer recognition (play the triggering phrase louder, slower, shorter or faster, etc). A reflection upon past and current events in one domain (\emph{``the computer missed my cue''}), induces a change in another, which in turn may lead to altered decisions in yet a third domain (\emph{``I should re-write the program''}). Although the same scenario could happen between two human performers, even if we disregard the comparatively limited interactive potential with the computer, its temporality makes the human-computer interaction distinct from human-human interaction. 
%The trajectories of reflection upon the missed cue, and its consequences, cause changes in the system which may not easily be traced back to the cause. 
%The differing modalities of reflection, which have their roots in differing temporalitites, may create a breach between the perception of the event and its cause. 

The different temporalities of the elements involved in an interactive performance such as the one described in Figure \ref{fig:player-comp}  and \ref{fig:player-comp-2}are important to understand and acknowledge for the arts based researcher. A computer, as a concept, and before  engaged in an interactive performance, may be seen as the ultimate representation of an over-time process: its operations are almost entirely independent of time. % Hence writing computer programs to be used in interactive performances is a difficult task, and using them is even more daunting.
The need to understand and evaluate the reasons for the changes in the computer output as well as the changes themselves, in an interactive computer performance, is without a doubt one of the more challenging aspects of being an artist engaged in real time digital art forms. It involves having to evaluate abstract and largely outside-of-time functionality of a computer programme in performance while simultaneously engaging in the temporal flux of the in-time progress of the output: using and writing computer programmes to be used in interactive performances are difficult tasks. % But in the process some aspects of the complexity of the multi-temporal capacity in the performer-listener feedback loops sketched above are revealed.
% In-time and over-time processes are not mutually exclusive; they can co-exist, but their zones of interaction may also result in noise and a distorted perception. 
% The ``shared time'' of music listening is in the context of interactive performances created through the performer-computer-listener feedback loops.
To hold different temporal representations active at the same time may be second nature for a musician, but the added aspect of the interactive computer makes it both more complex to understand and more difficult to perform, but it may also help the performer-researcher to understand and acknowledge these different temporalities. Not the least through the range of documentation possibilities it offers and which may be explored by the researching performer.

% A computer program written to perform in an interactive performance may have pre-conceived structures not unlike a musical composition or a structured improvisation and writing such a program is an over-time process similar to how composing is an over-time process. Furthermore writing a musical composition and performing it involves similar kinds of tensions between over-time and in-time decisions that may be found in the performance with an interactive computer. Now, whereas a musical score is not easily changed during a performance,\footnote{To be fair, any performed composition is altered by its performance in one way or another, but, in the Western art music tradition, radical in performance alterations of the written music are more likely to be called mistakes rather than interpretation.} in the case of the interactive computer, whatever the agenda used to construct the program, if the interaction is successfully exploited, the agenda may be altered. Not only in the performance but \emph{by} the performance. But this can of course only be true if we resist and challenge the simplicity of the click-and-response interaction discussed above (see Section \ref{sec:why-interaction}) and take full account of time and memory.

% The asymmetry in the trajectories of reflection discussed above is % also mirrored in the performer-computer-listener interactions. The % musical in-time evaluation on a series of events emanating from the % computer, made without knowledge of, or interest in their origin (i.e. % the musician's particular interaction with the computer), will not % necessarily correspond to an evaluation of the same events from % \emph{within} the process. The consequence may be that, in a response % to the performer's reflection, a change is introduced in the output % that, to a listener, who is primarily concerned with the audible % trace, and may be unaware or unconcerned with the details of the % musician-computer interaction, sounds awkward. The differing % modalities of reflection which have their roots in differing % temporalitites, creates a breach between the listener and the % performer. The temporal differences is one aspect of the issue at % stake here, but it is not the only one. 
% Due to a poor performance, bad programming or some other factor the % virtuality of the computer instrument fails to reveal itself and the % musical decisions made by the performer becomes enigmatic to the % listener.
% Either way,


\section*{Interacting with the Virtual}
\label{sec:inter-with-virt}

The almost mystical sensation of simultaneously being able to be in time, `now' and in memory, in the recollection of a previous now, is an important and powerful aspect of time-based arts in general and music in particular. Imagine listening to a well known melody being played. As the melody is unfolding there is a perpetual interaction between its in-memory representation and its real-time representation. Sometimes, if the memory of a particular music is really strong, it may overshadow the real life version of it and inversely, if the performance is powerful and expressive it may smear out the original memory, overwriting it with the new version. As was discussed above, it is tempting, and practical, to gather musical events into larger structures (e.g. notes into melodies, movements into symphonies, songs into song-cycles, etc.) and regard them as singularities, as image representations of what they represent. As such they would have no reference to time, their temporality would get transformed to a kind of spatiality and conceptually they would approach a representation of infinite time \citep{roads}, or, to put it in Iannis Xenakis's words, time is abolished in such structures: ``[O]ne could say that every temporal schema, pre-conceived or post-conceived, is a representation outside time of the temporal flux in which the phenomena, the entities, are  inscribed''. \citep[264]{xenakis71} They become virtual translations of the original in-time representations, similar to how the canvas that is the result of action painting may be seen as an outside-of-time representation of an in-time action. But if time really is abolished, how is it that we can keep track of such time specific data as duration, and silence, in memory representations of music, plays, movies, etc.? The question is not merely of theoretical or philosophical import, it has great impact on the way we understand and execute practice based research in the real-time arts. To examine an artistic practice from within---as opposed to examining it from the outside---we need to be able to access the object in real-time. And to gain access to it in real-time it is necessary to understand what real-time is relative to non real-time, i.e. in-memory representations.

In the survey of memory and imagination in Paul Ric{\oe}ur's seminal book \emph{Memory, History, Forgetting} among many other things in the first chapter, he critically discusses Husserl's concept of memory in general and the ideas of retention in particular.\footnote{The full meaning of this concept and the significance of Ric{\oe}ur's thinking upon it is far beyond the scope of this chapter. I use these sources as inspiration and I do not intend to unwrap a full philosophical discussion on time.} The duration of a musical note is used to address the question of what it means for something that endures to remain (but any other event unfolding in-time may equally well symbolize the phenomenon). And this is indeed at the heart of the matter for the present discussion: when in music, or any other real-time art form, we perform, there is a complex interplay between creation and duration. % Musicians do not only play series of instances that are sequentially combined, they play notes, phrases and gestures that have a duration. These entities can be accessed by the performer as a series of instants, or sub-entities, but also as a unity, a whole, that may signify something far beyond the sum of its parts. 
and the elements that make up the art work has both a virtual, in memory, and a real representation. These entities endure and as they develop in time, they create duration.

How is this possible? How can the present `now' and the memory of the past `nows' coexist? How can the memory of the preceding now co-exist with the memory of a now six months ago? Husserl, using with the sounding note as an example, states that the note, as it is played, makes the now perceptible, and, as it continues to sound it ``has an ever new now, and the now that immediately precedes it changes into a past.'' (Husserl, 1928; cited in \citealt[32]{ricoeur04}) The `ever new now' is what constitutes the modification in the perception that constructs the duration. The `now' that is pushed back by the `new' now however is not disappearing but is held on to, and it is this `holding on to' that Husserl labels \emph{retention}. \citep[32]{ricoeur04} Hence retention is, in a manner of speaking, a way to hold on to the note while it is sounding; as a modified perception of it. % It is not its memory, or recollection, but its modified perception. Retention is a modification of perception and the difference between retention and perception is first and foremost a temporal one. Perhaps it is possible to imagine an interaction between retention and  recollection. While the `now' continuously begins and recedes, with past nows sinking into retention, recollections rise from below and create a virtual now parallel to the real now.
The new now, that can never become the `real' but one which can trail the present and it can be experienced almost as if it took place in the real domain as a virtual (re-)presentation moving alongside of, or being pulled by, the real in a continuous flow in time. The real and the virtual as sketched above may further be seen as modes of perception: Outwards, listening to one's own or others's sounds as they disclose in time and inwards, listening to past experiences and memory representations. Both of these modes continuously co-exist and interact with one another.\footnote{These ideas are loosely related to how Susanne Kozel states that ``in every creative project there is an invisible'' (Chapter XX, Section \emph{Material Ontology} \S6). Henk Borgdorff's similarly speaks of a reality of the art work that ``precedes any re-presentation in the space of the conceptual.'' (Chapter XX, Section \emph{Some remarks on the epistemology...}, \S8)} 

The double reflection, reflection upon that which is present in a `now' and a reflection upon past experiences and memories, is by no means particular to the field of musical practice and it should be of interest to the arts based researcher to explore the difference between these two modes of reflection although it may require some methodological concerns. As mentioned above, video documentation has proven to be useful, but even with a video and audio recording of a performance, unwrapping the different processes and their influences upon the events may be difficult.\footnote{Evidence of this may be found in a study performed by the author in collaboration with Stefan \"{O}stersj\"{o} and described in \cite{frisk-ost06,frisk-ost06-2}. Despite numerous analysis of the video material it took us over six months working on the study to realize we had continuously misinterpreted what had really been going on in the documented session.} % Nevertheless, in the study of time, memory and perception, arts based research in the real time arts may reveal aspects of the subtle interactions of artistic practice that may prove to be useful knowledge far outside the compounds of that same practice.

% In practice the musician can not lean on only one of these modes but % must let both the real and the virtual listening modes % co-exist.\footnote{See also Susan Kozel's chapter in this Volume % Section \emph{Material Ontology} \S6.}

  \caption{The imaginary performance as sketched in Figure \ref{fig:player-comp} with the addition of time: past events are fading out but held on to by the performer (as is represented by the arrows pointing back unto previous nows). In other words, the reflection on past events is done in parallel with the reflection(s) on current events. Although it is not sketched here, the listener is likewise both `listening' to past events while participating in the current events. It should be noted that this is a extremely simplified graphic representation of phenomena that are infinitely more complex.}

\subsection*{Memory}
\label{sec:memory}


According to Henri Bergson we can look at the present-past axis as an inverted cone (think an ice-cream cone) where the tip is the present and the base represents the oldest unconscious memories. Each segment of this cone, where a segment is a line trisecting it somewhere between its point and its base, represents a virtual plane, a region in the past. \citep[][Ch.3]{bergson91} 
In Gilles Deleuze's reading of Bergson each such region contains the totality of the past in different levels of contraction or relaxation and at any time we can make a leap to any segment of the cone, to any past memory, bringing it back into consciousness. \citep[][60]{deleuze88} The cone is not to be understood as a storage device in which memories are put, slice by slice in succession, but rather it is an abstract visualisation of the human capacity to place oneself in the past, while still having access to everything prior to that particular point in time, as well as everything past it: ``It is in this sense that one can speak of the regions of Being itself, the ontological regions of the past `in general', all coexisting, all repeating one another.'' \citep[61]{deleuze88}
The cone symbolizes a dynamic process, more dynamic than what the image can represent, because there are several motions in simultaneous operation. The tip of the cone, which at all times represents the present moves perpetually along the plane of existence, ``of my actual representation of the universe'' \citep[152]{bergson91} all while the base of the cone remains still. If this is the horizontal movement there are corresponding vertical movements where pure memories are descending down to the tip, to where action takes place, and images from the present are ascending up into memory \citep[See also][47-8]{lawlor03}. In other words, we have (at least) two contrasting movements, one of the cone moving on the plane of existence and one inside the cone affecting the level of contraction at any virtual plane within the cone. Hence the virtual plane of memory is not a static \emph{image} of a time in the past, but a constantly changing one. Following this conceptualization of the relation between the present and the past, the idea of a temporal schema outside of time that Xenakis brought forth should perhaps be questioned. The memory of a musical event, does it not vividly hold on to the temporal aspect of its origin? Is it not so that the temporal relations between the events contained in a memory matters to its representation?

The virtual planes of memory discussed above are likely to be linked to the virtuality present in all artistic creation. Common to both the virtual planes of memory and to the virtuality of art practice, with or without technology is that, although they generate visual elements and images, they do not depend on them. While the mental leaps back and forth between the present and the past is a natural component to all performing art practices the jump to a virtual plane of the past in the spur of the moment of the performance may also create an unsurpassable breach: an ontological difference that, in the best case, fuels the performance and takes it to new heights, but at its worst, detaches it from the logic of the present. Under such circumstances the virtual plane fails to actualize itself and remains trapped in the memory of the performer(s).

% But in real-time performance, in improvisation---in the spur of the moment---the leap from `now' to a virtual plane of the past may create a breach similar to how musical decisions made based on information hidden from the listener creates a breach, as was discussed above.
% These leaps may be carried out as a result of affectivity within the performer or simply by aesthetic choices.

In Figure \ref{fig:u} the slice of time discussed earlier is now put into the context of a \emph{flow} of time. Past events are slowly sinking into retention all while the reflective listener-performer is able to make leaps back in time. Although only the activities of the performer are plotted, similar leaps back in time are obviously also performed by any given listener. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that the figure is a very rough image of \emph{some} of the processes going on. That time is of great importance to the real-time arts is perhaps self-evident, but the argument that has been pursued throughout this chapter is that the ways in which time operates in performance is of importance to the way arts based research may be carried out in these art forms and that research in this field may further our understanding of time and temporalities in more general terms. Many of the central issues that e.g. improvising performers (in any art form) learn and conquer, such as sensitivity to the other, synchronicity, timing, dialogue, interaction, embodiment, entrainment, etc. are concepts that are of great interest to both the natural and social sciences.\footnote{For an example where research in organisation theory turns to improvisation as a method, see \citep{lindahl03}} If arts based research is able to unpack and communicate some of the aspects concerning the in-time properties of their practice, many other research disciplines may benefit from and seek to further explore this knowledge.

\section*{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

The distinction between in-time and over-time processes in art that has been explored in this chapter is obviously not clear cut. Most art practices, as has already been pointed out, begin with some kind of over-time process in its stages of preparation. Even improvisatory practices, which depend extensively on in-time activities, commonly involve stages of preparation in which constraints and  limitations are set up. By introducing the interactive computer in this context the over-time articulations (artistic structures, constraints, form, etc.) may be brought into real-time performance, hence a layer of complexity is added for both the performer and the researcher. In the words of Susanne Kozel\footnote{See Chapter XX: The Virtual and the Physical, Section ``The constraints and urgencies of practice'', \S1} the computer may provide a structure that, in the interactions with a performer, constructs ``a topology of meaning''; in itself a valid metaphor for the holistic nature of the interactions between in-time and over-time processes that has been discussed in this chapter.

% Music has had an out-of-time spatial representation ever since musical notation was introduced. In the Western music history there is a tendency of disregarding the performative aspects of a musical work and regarding the score, i.e. its graphical representation, as equal to the identity of the work.\footnote{The topic is brought up by British improviser and composer Trevor Wishart who rhetorically asks what constitutes music: ``what we experience in the sounds, or what we might theoretically appreciate of the score through the sounds [\ldots].'' \cite{wis96}} Furthermore, with the advent of recording technology, not only the representation of sound in scores, but also sound itself has been transformed into space: ``We might say that recording is a reflux, or distillation in which time is boiled off, for time must be added back in to get sound, in the form of a steady motion of the turntable or tape heads or the crystal clock in digital recording.'' \citep[54]{evens05} In the engravings on an LP, or through the holes on the surface of a CD, the elusive nature of sound as embedded in time is captured and spatialized. The digital representation of sound in a computer is similarly spatialized: In other words, to even begin to think about using interactive computer technology in performance involves a transformation of the in-time embedded sound to an over-time representation.

% In his book \citetitle{dixon07} Steve Dixon discusses the problematic issue of `liveness' in performance. There is a common sense that technology have ``transformed or destabilized notions of liveness, presence, and the `real''', \citep[127]{dixon07} suggesting that the real-time arts somehow becomes less `live' when technology is made use of. Similar ideas have been discussed in this chapter based on the notion that the temporality of technology is different from the temporalities of live performance. Even though a performer (and an audience), simultaneously employs a number of different temporalities (as was discussed in Section \ref{sec:performing-time}), the addition of the computer appears to sometimes disrupt the in-time process in various ways. As if the over-time operations of the computer, however lightning fast these may be, is sometimes too much for the performance to carry, making it impossible for the interactive interface to inform the digital system in a useful way. The reasons for the failure may be due to poor interaction design but it may equally well be due to a limited understanding for the prerequisites of computer interaction on the part of the performers. Either way, in the way that the use of interactive computers in artistic practice highlights questions relating to in-time interaction makes it both artistically and conceptually interesting, and although the problems related to human-computer interaction in real-time artistic practice may be seen as particular to its context, any knowledge produced about the interaction and about the ways in which it may be improved, may well be of interest also outside of that field. The significance of arts based research in this context has at least two axes: (1) to more fully understand the notion of liveness and temporal embeddedness in the real-time arts involving computers, and (2) to inform the design of new human-computer interfaces.

% At the same time, research performed in this context may very well prove to be of great interest within the field of artistic practice as well as with regard to related fields of inquiry in the natural and social sciences. 

Over the last three or four decades a number of successful interactive art works have been produced, surpassing the limitations and quirks of digital systems. The `ideal' interactive performance system may hide its abstract functionality or may display its full power; it may be the invisible, virtual performer or it may be the dominating force in the interplay with human performers: considering the great range of expressions that have emanated from interactive technology over the last decades, from a purely artistic point of view there is no need to worry about the computer as a tool or vehicle for artistic production. Although there are a number of ways in which digital technology may be useful in artistic work of all kinds, of particular interest to the present discussion is the ways in which the real-time art practices may have needs and expectations on the technology that impacts on its further development. That the corporate world and the applied sciences has gleaned towards the arts for many years is no news. In 1970 the photo copying and computer company Rank Xerox started Xerox PARC, an entire lab dedicated to experimental and artistic work related to the products they developed (some of which had a great impact on the ways in which the modern interactive PC developed, see Steven \citet{johnson97}'s book \emph{Interface Culture} for an overview). The telephone company AT\&T's research department Bell Labs, where the foundation for present day information technology was laid out, similarly let composers and early sound artists such as James Tenney and Jean-Claude Risset work in their laboratories. And still today it is not difficult to find outreaches from the applied, natural and social sciences to the world of artistic practice for expertise on various matters. In particular the field of human-computer interaction seems to ask for input from artists. In a study on perception and performance in both human-technology interaction and music, authors \citeauthor{kirlik04} comment on the fact that ``design and training in many sociotechnical systems proceed all to often as if `doing it by the book' or working `like a machine' were admirable qualities.'' The hypothesis put forth by the authors is that by turning to musical practice, in particular musical improvisation, the design and understanding of the social aspects of human-computer interaction systems can be greatly improved. Designer and scholar Aukje \citeauthor{thomassen03} similarly mentions music as a means ``to fully research the applicability'' of the flow heuristic explored in his thesis and concludes that interdisciplinary work is needed and ``the major disciplines are the field of social sciences such as psychology and cultural studies, but also the field of the arts in particular music and fine arts.'' \citep[239]{thomassen03} Furthermore, according to authors \citeauthor{engestrom96}, there is a tendency to limit the thinking about human-computer interaction to ``microlevel interactions between programmers or users and computers. The broader social forces and structures that constrain such interactions and are themselves reproduced and molded by microlevel events are often left unexamined.'' arts based research in the real-time arts has much to contribute here and may provide a useful alternative to the  ``naive image of human-computer interaction as narrowly technical and as a problem of cognitive optimization''. \citep[325]{engestrom96} 

These are examples of areas in which arts based research in the real-time arts may interface with other research communities, and although there has been a general tendency on the part of the natural sciences to employ an overly romantic view on artistic practice, requests like the ones cited here, and similar ones, should not be neglected. That the results of the arts based research may not harmonize with the (scientific) expectations is beyond the point: there is an expectation that knowledge specific to the field of artistic practice may be useful in other, related fields of research. More specifically, because of the high demands they impose on technology and due to their largely non-traditional methods, the real-time arts involving computers have great potential to inform the  more general field of human-computer interaction research in ways that other research disciplines may not be able to do. Not the least in the ways that time and memory is dealt with and in the ways that the abstract, non-temporality of the computer has to be tackled. 

%In these processes the artistic practice, and the research performed within it, may inform the general development of human-computer interaction, from a social perspective, as well as from a technological perspective. From the point of view of practice based research this is interesting as it shows how the researching artist may be a concept of interest also outside the art world. 

% At least two aspects should be emphasized here: (1) Since many years there has been a demand for knowledge specific to the field of artistic practice.

It will always be tempting to approach the object of research as a whole rather than as a distributed agglomeration of interactions but throughout this chapter I have argued that understanding the mutual influence of the in-time and over-time aspects of the artistic practice is of great significance for the researcher engaged in arts based research. Furthermore, I have stressed that the use of interactive computer technology is of interest to the topic of arts based research in that it surfaces issues pertaining to time and temporalities in the context of real time arts, but also in the ways that it offers connections to adjoining research disciplines. % The memory image of an in-time process as a time spectrum; a spatial transformation in which time is abolished has been questioned in favour of an understanding of also memory

While this may be said to be true today, present day human-computer interaction can only be compared to human-human interaction if the notion of the latter is infinitely reduced. Nothing is gained by pretending that interactive computers in the context of real time performance are even comparable to the interactive potential in a human performer. On the opposite will we risk at reducing the meaning of concepts like `interaction', and `intelligent systems' into pointless concepts with nothing but potential market value. However,

Considering the important role perception, reflection, and sensibility to visual and auditory stimuli plays for artists in general and for the researching practitioner in particular, it should be of interest and great value for the researching artists to further the study of phenomena relating to time and interaction. Regardless of whether the practice involves technology or not, both the constructive and receptive phases of the artistic processes are of interest here, particularly if the research is performed in an interdisciplinary environment in interaction with, for example, the behavioral or computer sciences or, for that matter, in collaboration with other artistic disciplines. The scholarly study of computer games, an emerging field of inquiry by \citet{dixon07} depicted ``game performance theory'' (p. 621), may be a discipline of interest to the artistic researcher but also the computer games themselves, the programming of them and the practice of playing them, is an interesting arena for exploring ideas relating to time. The way that computer games create the illusion of immersion, and the way that they often participate in disrupting the time--space relations, makes them appear as contemporary and virtual incarnations of the \emph{Gesamtkunstverk}, and for Richard Wagner, at least towards the end of his vast production, questions connected to time and space were surfaced. In one of the central scenes in his opera \emph{Parsifal}, the protagonist's mentor Gurnemanz mystically explains to him: ``\emph{Du siehst, mein Sohn, zum Raum wird hier Zeit.}'' (You see, my son, time here becomes space). In a commentary to this scene\nocite{wagner82}, German composer Wolfgang Rihm points out the brilliance in the way Wagner stages the time to space transformation. It is not made by a sudden move but rather as a seemless transition, like a walk through a long series of infinitesimal transformations. (In a common stageing, along with the music in this passage, Gurnemanz and Parsifal are slowly walking towards a changeing landscape, backs turned to the audience.) When portraying the time to space transition, Wagner resists the non-temporal aspect of space that Xenakis is alluding to, and focuses on the movement, for, as Rihm states, the perception of space requires movement. \citep{rihm01} 

To Rihm time is movement. In a constant motion, events are sinking into time (similar to how the concept of retention was described above), and, according to Rihm, in the process, that, which we label musical material, is constructed. If musicological research has been focused on describing that material, arts based research should, among other things, concern itself with the motion that precedes it. Furthermore, that knowledge will not only be of interest to the practice itself and to the general field of art practice, but is also likely to be of interest to related fields of inquiry such as human-computer interaction and social practice.\footnote{In a current multilateral project, run by McGill University, Canada, the art of musical improvisation is used as a method to understand and further develop social work. \cite{lewis09}} In an interesting commentary on Heidegger's essay \emph{The question concerning technology} Aden \citet{evens05} concludes that ``art provides the best forum in which to pose and re-pose the question concerning the digital. [\ldots] Art pursues invention and so explores the limits of its media to forge new possibilities and discover unexpected directions.'' (p. 82) It is the responsibility of arts based research to make these possibilities, discoveries, and directions available to the researching community and to never cease to ask the question concerning time and technology.
