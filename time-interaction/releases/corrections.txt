culture, the virtual is nearly...

****

p. 280, last section, first sentence:

This sentence does not appear to me to be correct English
"to tie the action to the object" or "to link the action and the object", but I'm not sure. 
At the end of the sentece: should temporalities be 'the temporalities'?

****

p. 282, second section, last sentence:

There is no mention of Xenakis's book prior to this (other than the reference page 281). Is it possible to insert the title ("Formalized Music") here?

Shouldn't this be in plural when it refers to reflections: "Although they are unlikely..."?

Should 'why' be capitalized? 

****

p. 286: last sentence before 'Interacting with the virtual':

'However it may also...': Isn't 'it' ambiguous here? It is supposed to refer to 'computer' but I'm not sure if it does? Perhaps change to "Using computers, however, may also..."

Insert comma between 'reflection' and 'although'?

'their practice' should be changed to 'artistic practicies' OR the beginning of the sentence should be changed to 'If arts based researchers are...'. I believe that in either case practice should be in plural.

The capitalization is incorrect here: I believe it should be "Raum, Zeit, hier. Bemerkungen zu einen Axiom Wagners", but I don't have the original here. Henrik?
