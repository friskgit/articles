\begin{abstract}
  In this essay I look at various aspects of the conscious/unconscious
  continuum in relation to freely improvised music and in relation to
  the computer-as-instrument and the computer-as-improviser. Drawing
  on the work of anthropologist Gregory Bateson I make use of the idea
  that the unconcious is structured in a manner distinct from the
  conscious. Furthermore I evaluate the assumption that art in general
  and improvisation specifically, communicates according to the logic
  of the unconscious. These two arguments are used to give an
  experimental account as to the validity of using the computer as an
  instrument in the context of freely improvised music.
