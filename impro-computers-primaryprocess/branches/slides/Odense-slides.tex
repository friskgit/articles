\section{Improvisation: definition?}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{What is Improvisation?}
  % - A title should summarize the slide in an understandable fashion
  %   for anyone how does not follow everything on the slide itself.

  \begin{block}
    
  \begin{itemize}

  \item<1-> A substitute for organization?

  \item<2- | alert@4> Bruno Nettl: ``[i]n the conception of the art music world,
    improvisation embodies the absence of precise planning and
    discipline'' {\footnotesize(\emph{An art neglected in
        scholarship})}

  \item<3-> Bruno Nettl: ``discipline, intricacy, and control of
    complexities all play major roles in various kinds of
    improvisation'' {\footnotesize (\emph{Ibid.})}

  \item<5-> But, improvisation is \emph{also} absence of control.

  \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Basis for current discussion}
  \begin{block}{The nature of improvisation}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> Lack of control may in fact be important features.
    \item<2-> Computer technology may help to `un-learn' stylistically bound musical knowledge.
    \item<3-> The `un-learning' may be understood in terms of the concept of \emph{primary process}.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\section{Computers and Improvisation}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Computers and Improvisation}
  \begin{block}<1->{Computers-as-improvisers}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<2-> Computers are poor improvisers.
    \item<3-> The human capacity for making ``good choices'' spontaneously is enormous
      and still close to impossible to model in a computer program.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}<4->{Computers-as-instruments}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<5-> A human `computer-player' is the interface.
    \item<6-> Any sound is possible: dream or disaster?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Computer and Improvisation}
  \begin{block}{Summary}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> Non-intuitive musical UI.
    \item<2-> No physical contact between body and sound.
    \item<3-> No unified notion of what the computer-as-instrument consist of.
    \item<4-> The computer is useless as an instrument for improvisation(?)
    \item<5-| alert@5> Yet, the computer is an agent in the practice of improvisation.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\section{Improvisation and the Mind}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Improvisation and sensibility}
  \begin{block}{Personhood}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> G. Lewis: ``Afrological sensibility''
    \item<2-> G. Russel: ``Intuitive Intelligence''
    \item<3-> The personal sound.
    \item<4-> Conclusion: Improvised music thrives on sensibility.
    \item<5-> In what sense may the computer be an agent of sensibility?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Primary process}
  \begin{block}{The language of the unconscious}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> Bateson: The Algorithms of the heart.
    \item<2-> Music as a method of translation between primary and secondary process.
    \item<3-> Habit: actions become unconscious.
    \item<4-> Habit formation is not a guarantee for access to the unconscious.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\section{In practice}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Ornette Coleman}
  \begin{block}{Picking up the violin and the trumpet.}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> To rid himself of the Parker legacy.
    \item<2-> Striving to play ``without memory''
    \item<3-> Free from extra-musical parameters: Denardo Coleman
    \item<4-> Unknown instruments gave him internal freedom, liberated from physical memory.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Marcel Duchamp}
  \begin{block}{\emph{The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even
        (The Large Glass)} (1915-1923)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> To rid himself of old fashioned drawing.
    \item<2-> Knowledge reversed but not forgotten: Memory as a function of the future''
    \item<3-> Duchamp: ``I unlearned to draw. The point was to forget
      \emph{with my hand}.''
    \item<4-> To consciously unlearn: Is it at all possible?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\section{Why computers?}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Resistance}
  \begin{block}{Why forget?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> To \emph{increase} resistance.
    \item<2-> To oppose habit.
    \item<3-> The computer is an agent in improvised music not despite its shortcomings but \emph{thanks to them}
    \item<4-> Frustration of an instrument's shortcomings are secondary process. 
    \item<5-> Playing it is primary process.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Summary}
  \begin{block}<1->{The computer as a forgetting machine}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<2-> Musicians and artist have developed methods to achieve
      that which the computer allows us do prior to its existence.
    \item<3-> Habit formation is economy of conscious thought rather than access to unconscious.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}<4->{Aden Evens and the body}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<5-> ``The musician who just allows his body to do what it
      will cannot be immerse in the music [\ldots] the one who lets his body play is not putting
      himself on the line''
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
