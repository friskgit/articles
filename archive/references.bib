  abstract =	 { Recent philosophical tendencies of “Actor-Network
                  Theory,” “Object-Oriented Ontology,” and
                  “Speculative Realism” have profoundly challenged the
                  centrality of subjectivity in the humanities, and
                  many artists and curators, particularly in the UK,
                  Germany, and the United States, appear deeply
                  influenced by this shift from epistemology to
                  ontology. October editors asked artists, historians,
                  and philosophers invested in these projects—from
                  Graham Harman and Alexander R. Galloway to Armen
                  Avanessian and Patricia Falguières to Ed Atkins and
                  Amie Siegel—to explore what the rewards and risks of
                  assigning agency to objects may be, and how, or if,
                  such new materialisms can be productive for making
                  and thinking about art today. }
