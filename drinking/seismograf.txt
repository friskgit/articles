Dear all contributors,

 

It is with the greatest relieve, proud- and happiness that we yesterday launched the new Seismograf special issue “Sonic Argumentation”.

Thank you so much to all of you for the fruitful discussions along the way, for bringing new insights to the format of the audio paper and - of course - for your rich
contributions.

 

Please share as much as you like.
